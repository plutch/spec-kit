## What's Changing

### Legacy Clarify Workflow

```
1. Load spec
2. Run taxonomy-based ambiguity scan (9 categories)
3. Generate 5 questions from Partial/Missing categories
4. Ask questions sequentially
5. Update spec with answers
```

**Characteristics:**
- Fast execution (~30-60 seconds)
- Low token cost (~2,000 tokens)
- Pattern-based question generation
- No optimization suggestions
- No contradiction detection

### Deep Review Workflow

```
1. Load spec
2. Run taxonomy-based ambiguity scan (same 9 categories)
3. [NEW] Deep Review Analysis (sequential thinking)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Pass 1: Logic Validation
   ‚îú‚îÄ Pass 2: Completeness Analysis
   ‚îú‚îÄ Pass 3: Optimization Analysis
   ‚îî‚îÄ Pass 4: Synthesis ‚Üí Top 5 questions
4. Ask questions sequentially (with trade-off analysis)
5. Update spec with answers
```

**Characteristics:**
- Moderate execution (~60-180 seconds, mode-dependent)
- Higher token cost (~5,000-15,000 tokens, mode-dependent)
- AI-reasoning-based question generation
- Optimization suggestions included
- Contradiction detection built-in

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Legacy | Deep Review |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Analysis Depth** | Pattern matching | Multi-pass AI reasoning |
| **Token Cost** | ~2,000 | ~5,000-15,000 (configurable) |
| **Execution Time** | 30-60s | 60-180s (mode-dependent) |
| **Contradictions** | Not detected | Explicitly identified |
| **Optimizations** | Not suggested | Alternatives + trade-offs |
| **Question Quality** | Coverage-based | Impact-scored |
| **Scope Reduction** | Not offered | Suggested when appropriate |
| **ROI** | Baseline | 2-3x via prevented rework |
| **Configuration** | None | Extensive (modes, domains) |
| **Fallback** | N/A | Degrades to legacy if MCP unavailable |

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Gradual Rollout (Recommended)

**Best for**: Production teams, risk-averse organizations

**Approach:**
1. Keep legacy clarify as default
2. Add deep review as opt-in (`/speckit.clarify --deep`)
3. Pilot with 3-5 team members on new features
4. Collect feedback for 2-4 weeks
5. Make deep review default (with opt-out)
6. Eventually deprecate legacy (6+ months)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Zero disruption to existing workflows
- ‚úÖ Team can learn gradually
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback if issues arise
- ‚úÖ Gather real-world performance data

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Slower adoption
- ‚ùå Requires maintaining two commands
- ‚ùå Team may resist switching

**Timeline:** 2-6 months

---

### Strategy 2: Feature Flag Rollout

**Best for**: Teams with existing feature flag infrastructure

**Approach:**
1. Add config flag: `clarify.use_deep_review: false` (default off)
2. Enable for pilot users/projects
3. Monitor performance and feedback
4. Gradually increase rollout percentage (25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
5. Remove flag once stable

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Gradual rollout with easy control
- ‚úÖ Can roll back instantly
- ‚úÖ Measure performance differences
- ‚úÖ Users don't need to remember flags

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires config infrastructure
- ‚ùå Inconsistent experience during rollout
- ‚ùå May confuse users (why different results?)

**Timeline:** 1-3 months

---

### Strategy 3: Immediate Replacement

**Best for**: Small teams, greenfield projects, token budget not constrained

**Approach:**
1. Replace `clarify.md` with `clarify-deep.md`
2. Keep legacy as `clarify-fast.md` (opt-out)
3. Announce change to team
4. Monitor first 5-10 feature specs closely

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Fastest adoption
- ‚úÖ Immediate benefits for all features
- ‚úÖ Simple (one command to rule them all)
- ‚úÖ Clean implementation

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Potential shock to team workflow
- ‚ùå Higher token costs surprise users
- ‚ùå Harder rollback (affects all in-flight features)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

### Strategy 4: Hybrid Approach (Auto-Detection)

**Best for**: Teams wanting smart defaults

**Approach:**
1. Replace `clarify.md` with auto-detecting version
2. Simple features use legacy mode automatically
3. Complex features use deep review automatically
4. Users can override with `--deep` or `--fast` flags

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds (cost-effective for simple, deep for complex)
- ‚úÖ No user decision fatigue
- ‚úÖ Optimizes token spend automatically
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Auto-detection may be wrong sometimes
- ‚ùå Inconsistent experience (by design)
- ‚ùå Requires tuning detection thresholds

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Option A: Gradual Rollout (Recommended)

#### Phase 1: Installation (Week 1)

**Step 1: Backup existing clarify command**

```bash
# From spec-kit repo root
cd templates/commands
cp clarify.md clarify-legacy.md
```

**Step 2: Add deep review as separate command**

```bash
# Keep both commands available
# clarify.md = legacy (default)
# clarify-deep.md = new (opt-in)
```

**Step 3: Create configuration file**

```bash
mkdir -p .specify
cp .specify/config.example.yml .specify/config.yml
```

Edit `.specify/config.yml`:
```yaml
clarify:
  deep_review:
    enabled: true  # Allow opt-in via --deep flag
    default_mode: "balanced"  # When explicitly enabled
```

**Step 4: Update CLI to support new command** (if separate command approach)

Edit `src/specify_cli/__init__.py`:
```python
# Add new command registration
@app.command(name="clarify-deep", help="Enhanced clarification with deep review")
def clarify_deep_command(args: str = ""):
    # Load clarify-deep.md template
    pass
```

Or keep single command with flag parsing:
```python
@app.command(name="clarify")
def clarify_command(
    args: str = "",
    deep: bool = typer.Option(False, "--deep", help="Enable deep review analysis"),
    fast: bool = typer.Option(False, "--fast", help="Skip deep review (legacy mode)")
):
    if deep:
        # Load clarify-deep.md
        pass
    else:
        # Load clarify.md (legacy)
        pass
```

**Step 5: Test installation**

```bash
# Test legacy still works
/speckit.specify "test feature"
/speckit.clarify

# Test deep review (if using flag approach)
/speckit.clarify --deep

# Or test separate command
/speckit.clarify-deep
```

#### Phase 2: Pilot Program (Weeks 2-3)

**Step 6: Select pilot features**

Criteria for pilot features:
- ‚úÖ Medium-to-high complexity (15+ requirements)
- ‚úÖ Not time-critical (can afford extra analysis time)
- ‚úÖ Domain with existing patterns (auth, payment, multi-tenant)
- ‚úÖ Team members open to feedback

**Step 7: Run pilot with 3-5 features**

For each pilot feature:
```bash
# Create spec as normal
/speckit.specify "feature description"

# Use deep review for clarification
/speckit.clarify --deep  # or /speckit.clarify-deep

# Document experience:
# - Token cost actual vs estimated
# - Time taken
# - Question quality (1-5 rating)
# - Optimization suggestions usefulness
# - Issues encountered
```

**Step 8: Collect structured feedback**

Use this template:

```markdown
## Deep Review Pilot Feedback

**Feature**: [Name]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Reviewer**: [Name]

### Metrics
- Token cost: [actual] vs [estimated]
- Time taken: [actual] vs [estimated]
- Spec complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Mode used: [Fast/Balanced/Thorough]

### Quality Assessment (1-5 scale)
- Question relevance: [1-5]
- Optimization suggestions: [1-5]
- Trade-off analysis clarity: [1-5]
- Overall experience: [1-5]

### Specific Feedback
**What worked well:**
- [feedback]

**What didn't work:**
- [feedback]

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- [feedback]

**Would you use this for future features?** [Yes/No/Maybe]
```

**Step 9: Analyze pilot results**

Aggregate metrics:
- Average token cost vs legacy
- Average time increase
- Question quality improvement (if measurable)
- Adoption recommendation rate

Decision criteria:
- ‚úÖ **Proceed to rollout** if:
  - >70% would use for future features
  - Token cost within acceptable range
  - No critical bugs/issues
  - Question quality noticeably better

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Iterate** if:
  - 40-70% adoption recommendation
  - Token costs higher than expected
  - Minor issues identified
  - Mixed feedback on quality

- ‚ùå **Reconsider** if:
  - <40% adoption recommendation
  - Critical bugs or workflow blockers
  - Token costs prohibitive
  - No clear quality improvement

#### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 4-6)

**Step 10: Make deep review the default**

```bash
# Replace default clarify command
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-legacy.md
mv clarify-deep.md clarify.md
```

Update documentation:
```bash
# Update README
# - Clarify command now uses deep review by default
# - Add --fast flag for legacy behavior
# - Document token cost expectations
```

**Step 11: Announce to team**

Email/Slack template:
```
üì£ Spec-Kit Enhancement: Deep Review Clarification

Starting [date], the /speckit.clarify command now includes AI-powered deep review
analysis. This catches contradictions, suggests optimizations, and improves
specification quality.

What's changing:
- Analysis is more thorough (contradictions, completeness, optimizations)
- Takes 60-180 seconds instead of 30-60 seconds (mode-dependent)
- Uses 5,000-15,000 tokens instead of ~2,000 tokens
- Questions include trade-off analysis and recommendations

Benefits:
- 2-3x fewer issues discovered in planning/implementation
- Optimization suggestions can reduce scope 20-40%
- Better architecture decisions upfront

Pilot results:
- [X] features tested
- [Y]% of users recommend adoption
- Average [Z] tokens saved in downstream rework

If you need faster clarification (simple features):
  /speckit.clarify --fast

For complex/critical features (best analysis):
  /speckit.clarify --thorough

Questions? Contact [team lead] or see: docs/deep-review-configuration.md
```

**Step 12: Monitor adoption**

Track for first month:
- % of clarifications using deep review vs legacy
- Token costs (actual vs budgeted)
- User-reported issues
- Downstream rework reduction (qualitative)

**Step 13: Optimize configuration**

Based on actual usage, tune `.specify/config.yml`:
```yaml
clarify:
  deep_review:
    # Adjust default mode based on average feature complexity
    default_mode: "balanced"  # or "fast" if mostly simple features

    # Tune auto-enable thresholds based on sweet spot
    auto_enable:
      min_requirements: 15  # Increase if too many simple features trigger deep review
      min_complexity_score: 50  # Tune based on false positive rate

    # Adjust token limits based on budget
    token_limits:
      max_tokens_per_review: 20000
      warn_at_tokens: 15000
```

#### Phase 4: Refinement (Month 2+)

**Step 14: Add custom domain patterns**

Based on your tech stack:
```yaml
clarify:
  deep_review:
    domain_patterns:
      # Add custom domains for your projects
      ecommerce:
        keywords: ["cart", "checkout", "inventory", "shipping"]
        questions:
          - "How should cart abandonment be handled?"
          - "What inventory synchronization strategy is required?"
          - "Are there shipping calculation requirements?"

      analytics:
        keywords: ["dashboard", "metrics", "reporting", "analytics"]
        questions:
          - "What is the maximum acceptable data latency?"
          - "Are there data retention policies?"
          - "What export formats are required?"
```

**Step 15: Build team expertise**

- Document common patterns from clarification sessions
- Share examples of good optimization decisions
- Create internal best practices guide

**Step 16: Deprecate legacy (optional, 6+ months)**

If adoption is universal and no issues:
```bash
# Remove legacy command entirely
rm templates/commands/clarify-legacy.md

# Remove --fast flag from CLI
# Update documentation
```

---

### Option B: Immediate Replacement (Fast Track)

**For small teams or greenfield projects:**

```bash
# 1. Backup legacy
cd templates/commands
cp clarify.md clarify-legacy.md

# 2. Replace with deep review
mv clarify-deep.md clarify.md

# 3. Create config
mkdir -p .specify
cp .specify/config.example.yml .specify/config.yml

# 4. Announce to team
# 5. Monitor first 5-10 features closely

# Keep legacy available as opt-out:
# /speckit.clarify --legacy  (or --fast)
```

**Rollback** (if issues):
```bash
# Quick rollback
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-deep-temp.md
mv clarify-legacy.md clarify.md
```

---

## Testing & Validation

### Pre-Migration Testing

**Test 1: Legacy Baseline**

```bash
# Create test spec with known issues
/speckit.specify "User authentication with SSO and password reset"

# Run legacy clarify, document:
/speckit.clarify
# - Questions asked
# - Time taken
# - Token cost
# - Issues NOT caught (contradictions, missing requirements)
```

**Test 2: Deep Review Comparison**

```bash
# Same spec, deep review
/speckit.clarify --deep
# - Questions asked (compare to legacy)
# - Time taken (compare)
# - Token cost (compare)
# - Issues caught (contradictions, optimizations)
```

**Test 3: Edge Cases**

Test with:
- Very simple spec (5 requirements) ‚Üí should use fast mode
- Very complex spec (30+ requirements) ‚Üí should use thorough mode
- Spec with obvious contradictions ‚Üí should detect in Pass 1
- Spec with domain keywords (auth, payment) ‚Üí should apply domain patterns

### Post-Migration Validation

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Legacy clarify still accessible (if keeping as fallback)
- [ ] Deep review works for simple features (fast mode)
- [ ] Deep review works for complex features (thorough mode)
- [ ] Configuration file loads correctly
- [ ] Custom domain patterns apply when keywords detected
- [ ] Questions include trade-off analysis
- [ ] Spec updates correctly after each answer
- [ ] Token usage within expected range
- [ ] MCP sequential thinking server accessible (or fallback works)
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, help text)

### Regression Testing

Test that existing functionality still works:
- [ ] `/speckit.specify` creates specs normally
- [ ] `/speckit.clarify` (default) works end-to-end
- [ ] `/speckit.plan` works after clarification
- [ ] All scripts (bash/powershell) still execute
- [ ] Git integration unaffected
- [ ] Agent context files update correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "Sequential thinking MCP server not available"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking tool not found
Falling back to legacy clarify mode...
```

**Cause:** MCP server not installed or not running

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check MCP servers
claude-code --list-mcp-servers

# If missing, install sequential thinking server
# (installation method depends on your setup)

# Temporary workaround: use legacy mode
/speckit.clarify --fast
```

---

#### Issue 2: Token costs higher than expected

**Symptoms:**
- Balanced mode using 15,000+ tokens instead of ~10,000
- Warnings about token limit exceeded

**Cause:** Spec complexity higher than typical, or analysis finding many issues

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Reduce token limits in config
clarify:
  deep_review:
    default_mode: "fast"  # Down from "balanced"
    token_limits:
      max_tokens_per_review: 10000  # Down from 20000
```

Or use fast mode for that feature:
```bash
/speckit.clarify --fast
```

---

#### Issue 3: Deep review taking too long

**Symptoms:**
- Analysis taking 3-5 minutes instead of 1-2 minutes
- Blocking team workflow

**Cause:** Thorough mode activated unnecessarily, or complex spec

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Tune auto-detection to be less aggressive
clarify:
  deep_review:
    auto_enable:
      min_requirements: 20  # Up from 15
      min_complexity_score: 60  # Up from 50
```

Or explicitly use faster mode:
```bash
/speckit.clarify --balanced  # Instead of thorough
```

---

#### Issue 4: Questions seem generic or low-quality

**Symptoms:**
- Questions don't seem better than legacy
- No optimization suggestions
- Missing domain-specific questions

**Cause:** Domain patterns not configured, or spec lacks keywords

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Add custom domain patterns
clarify:
  deep_review:
    domain_patterns:
      your_domain:
        keywords: ["specific", "terms", "from", "your", "stack"]
        questions:
          - "Domain-specific question 1?"
          - "Domain-specific question 2?"
```

---

#### Issue 5: Spec updates not saving correctly

**Symptoms:**
- Answers recorded in Clarifications section
- But other sections not updated with details

**Cause:** Spec structure doesn't match expected template

**Solution:**
- Ensure spec has standard sections (Functional Requirements, Data Model, etc.)
- Check markdown structure is valid (no unclosed code blocks)
- Manually update sections if auto-update fails

---

#### Issue 6: Configuration not loading

**Symptoms:**
- Config changes have no effect
- Always uses default mode

**Cause:** Config file not in correct location or invalid YAML

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify config file location
ls -la .specify/config.yml

# Validate YAML syntax
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.specify/config.yml'))"

# Check for typos in keys
# - clarify (not clarrify)
# - deep_review (not deepreview)
```

---

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
# If CLI supports debug flag
/speckit.clarify --deep --debug

# Or set environment variable
export SPECIFY_DEBUG=1
/speckit.clarify --deep
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (Immediate)

**If critical issue blocking team:**

```bash
# 1. Restore legacy command
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-deep-broken.md
mv clarify-legacy.md clarify.md

# 2. Notify team
echo "Deep review temporarily disabled due to [issue]. Using legacy clarify until resolved."

# 3. Document issue for investigation
# 4. Resume normal workflow
```

**Time to rollback:** <5 minutes

---

### Gradual Rollback

**If adoption isn't working but no critical issue:**

```bash
# 1. Change config to opt-in only
# Edit .specify/config.yml
clarify:
  deep_review:
    enabled: false  # Disable by default

# 2. Keep deep review available for those who want it
# /speckit.clarify --deep

# 3. Reassess in 4-8 weeks
```

---

### Partial Rollback

**If only certain modes have issues:**

```yaml
# Disable thorough mode, keep balanced/fast
clarify:
  deep_review:
    default_mode: "balanced"  # Down from "thorough"
    auto_enable:
      complex_features_section: false  # Disable thorough trigger
      min_clarification_markers: 5  # Increase threshold
```

## Timeline Summary

### Gradual Rollout (Recommended)

| Week | Phase | Activities | Milestone |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Installation | Setup, config, CLI changes | Deep review available opt-in |
| 2-3 | Pilot | 3-5 features tested, feedback collected | Decision to proceed |
| 4 | Rollout | Make default, team announcement | Deep review default |
| 5-8 | Refinement | Monitor, tune config, custom domains | Stable adoption |
| 12+ | Optimization | Deprecate legacy (optional) | Full migration |

**Total:** 2-6 months to full adoption

### Fast Track

| Week | Phase | Activities | Milestone |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Replace | Swap commands, announce to team | Deep review default |
| 2-3 | Monitor | Track first 10 features closely | Stable operation |

**Total:** 2-3 weeks to full adoption

## Checklist

Use this to track migration progress:

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Review deep review documentation
- [ ] Decide on migration strategy (gradual/immediate/hybrid)
- [ ] Identify pilot team members (if gradual)
- [ ] Create rollback plan
- [ ] Prepare training materials

### Installation
- [ ] Backup legacy clarify command
- [ ] Add deep review command/template
- [ ] Create configuration file
- [ ] Update CLI (if needed for flags)
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### Pilot (if applicable)
- [ ] Select 3-5 pilot features
- [ ] Run deep review on pilot features
- [ ] Collect structured feedback
- [ ] Analyze results
- [ ] Decide go/no-go for rollout

### Rollout
- [ ] Make deep review default (or enable feature flag)
- [ ] Announce to team
- [ ] Provide training session
- [ ] Share quick reference materials
- [ ] Monitor adoption metrics

### Post-Rollout
- [ ] Track token costs (actual vs budget)
- [ ] Monitor user-reported issues
- [ ] Tune configuration based on usage
- [ ] Add custom domain patterns
- [ ] Measure success metrics
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### Optimization (ongoing)
- [ ] Review token economics monthly
- [ ] Tune auto-detection thresholds
- [ ] Expand domain pattern library
- [ ] Build internal best practices guide
- [ ] Consider deprecating legacy (6+ months)

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I mix legacy and deep review for different features?**
A: Yes! Use `--deep` or `--fast` flags to override defaults per-feature.

**Q: What if my token budget is limited?**
A: Use fast mode by default, reserve deep review for complex/critical features only.

**Q: Can I customize the analysis passes?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. You can tune token limits and enable/disable entire passes in config.

**Q: What if MCP sequential thinking isn't available?**
A: System automatically falls back to legacy clarify mode. No disruption.

**Q: How do I know if deep review is worth the cost for my team?**
A: Run pilot on 3-5 features and measure: (1) Token cost, (2) Issues caught early, (3) Downstream rework reduction. If rework savings > 2x cost, it's worth it.

## Appendix: Migration Decision Tree

```
Start here: Should I migrate to deep review?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Do I have MCP sequential thinking available?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí WAIT until MCP available, or use legacy only
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ What's my token budget constraint?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Very tight (<5k per feature) ‚Üí Use legacy or fast mode only
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Moderate (5-15k per feature) ‚Üí Gradual rollout, use balanced mode
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Flexible (>15k per feature) ‚Üí Immediate rollout, use thorough mode
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ What's my team size?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ 1-3 people ‚Üí Immediate replacement (fast migration)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ 4-10 people ‚Üí Gradual rollout (pilot + rollout)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ 10+ people ‚Üí Feature flag rollout (controlled)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ What's my typical feature complexity?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Mostly simple CRUD ‚Üí Legacy sufficient, or use fast mode
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Mix of simple + complex ‚Üí Hybrid approach (auto-detection)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Mostly complex ‚Üí Deep review high value, immediate rollout
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ What's my risk tolerance?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Low (production critical) ‚Üí Gradual rollout with 4-6 week pilot
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Medium ‚Üí 2-week pilot, then rollout
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ High (can tolerate issues) ‚Üí Immediate replacement
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Recommendation:
   ‚îú‚îÄ GRADUAL ROLLOUT if: Medium-large team, moderate budget, medium risk tolerance
   ‚îú‚îÄ FEATURE FLAG if: Large team, existing flag infrastructure, low risk tolerance
   ‚îú‚îÄ IMMEDIATE if: Small team, flexible budget, high risk tolerance
   ‚îî‚îÄ HYBRID (auto-detect) if: Mix of complexities, want smart defaults
```
