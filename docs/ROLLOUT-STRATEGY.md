# Deep Review Rollout Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides prescriptive rollout strategies for adopting deep review clarification based on team size, risk tolerance, and organizational context.

**Key Decision Factors:**
- Team size (1-3, 4-10, 10+ developers)
- Token budget constraints
- Risk tolerance (production impact)
- Feature complexity profile
- Existing infrastructure

---

## Quick Recommendations

| Team Profile | Recommended Strategy | Timeline | Risk |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|------|
| **Startup (1-5 devs)** | Immediate Replacement | 1-2 weeks | Low |
| **Scale-up (6-20 devs)** | Gradual Rollout | 4-8 weeks | Low |
| **Enterprise (20+ devs)** | Feature Flag Rollout | 8-12 weeks | Very Low |
| **Agency/Consultancy** | Project-Based Adoption | Per-project | Medium |
| **Open Source Project** | Opt-In with Documentation | Ongoing | Low |

---

## Strategy 1: Immediate Replacement

**Best For:**
- Startups (1-5 developers)
- Greenfield projects
- Teams with flexible token budgets
- High trust in new tooling

### Implementation Plan

#### Week 1: Day 1-2 (Setup)

**Morning:**
```bash
# 1. Backup existing command
cd templates/commands
cp clarify.md clarify-legacy.md
git add clarify-legacy.md
git commit -m "backup: preserve legacy clarify command"

# 2. Replace with deep review
mv clarify-deep.md clarify.md
git add clarify.md
git commit -m "feat: upgrade to deep review clarification"

# 3. Update CLI (if needed for --fast flag)
# Edit src/specify_cli/__init__.py to add --fast option
```

**Afternoon:**
```bash
# 4. Create default configuration
mkdir -p .specify
cp .specify/config.example.yml .specify/config.yml

# 5. Customize config for your stack
# Edit .specify/config.yml:
# - Set default_mode based on typical feature complexity
# - Add custom domain patterns for your tech stack
# - Set token limits based on budget

# 6. Test on sample spec
/speckit.specify "Test feature: User settings page"
/speckit.clarify --debug  # Verify deep review runs

# 7. Document changes
# Update README.md with new clarify behavior
# Add section on token costs and modes
```

#### Week 1: Day 3-5 (Rollout)

**Team Announcement Template:**

```markdown
## 🚀 Spec-Kit Upgrade: Deep Review Clarification

**Effective:** [Today's date]
**Impact:** All new features

### What's Changing

The `/speckit.clarify` command now includes AI-powered deep review analysis:
- Catches contradictions in requirements
- Suggests optimizations (e.g., managed services vs custom builds)
- Provides trade-off analysis for decisions
- Identifies security/compliance gaps

### Example

Before (Legacy):
- Question: "What password policy is required?"
- Answer: "12+ characters, complexity required"

After (Deep Review):
- Question: "Should this use custom auth or managed provider (Auth0)?"
- Options with trade-offs: Auth0 (faster, proven) vs Custom (flexible, DIY)
- Recommendation: Auth0 for faster MVP, lower security risk
- Impact: Saves 3-4 weeks development time

### New Behavior

- **Analysis time:** 60-180 seconds (was 30-60 seconds)
- **Token cost:** 5,000-15,000 tokens (was ~2,000 tokens)
- **Benefit:** 2-3x fewer issues found in planning/implementation

### Modes Available

- **Default:** Auto-detects complexity (balanced for most features)
- **Fast:** `/speckit.clarify --fast` (legacy behavior, simple features)
- **Thorough:** `/speckit.clarify --deep` (critical features, max analysis)

### When to Use Fast Mode

Use `--fast` for:
- Simple CRUD (user profile, settings)
- Prototypes/spikes
- Time-critical specs (need quick turnaround)

### Documentation

- Full guide: `docs/deep-review-configuration.md`
- Examples: `docs/deep-review-example.md`
- Comparison: `docs/legacy-vs-deep-review-comparison.md`

### Questions?

Slack: #spec-kit channel
Contact: [tech lead name]
```

**Day 3-5 Activities:**
- Send announcement to team
- Monitor first 5 features closely
- Be available for questions
- Collect informal feedback

#### Week 2: Iteration

**Metrics to Track:**
```yaml
# Track in shared spreadsheet or tool
features_using_deep_review:
  - feature_name: "User authentication"
    date: 2025-10-24
    mode_used: balanced
    token_cost_actual: 9850
    token_cost_estimated: 10000
    time_seconds: 95
    issues_caught: 5
    user_satisfaction: 4/5
    would_use_again: yes
```

**Tuning Configuration:**

Based on first week usage:
```yaml
# If features are simpler than expected, reduce default mode
clarify:
  deep_review:
    default_mode: "fast"  # Down from "balanced"

# If features are more complex, increase thresholds
clarify:
  deep_review:
    auto_enable:
      min_requirements: 20  # Up from 15
      min_complexity_score: 60  # Up from 50
```

**Feedback Session:**

End of Week 2, 30-minute team sync:
- What worked well?
- What was confusing?
- Any features where deep review didn't help?
- Any features where it saved significant time?
- Should default mode be adjusted?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% of new features use clarify (default or explicit mode)
- [ ] <2 rollback requests
- [ ] Token costs within budget (no surprises)
- [ ] >60% of team satisfied with change
- [ ] No critical bugs blocking workflow

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
```bash
# Quick rollback (5 minutes)
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-deep-broken.md
mv clarify-legacy.md clarify.md
git add . && git commit -m "rollback: restore legacy clarify due to [issue]"

# Notify team
# Investigate issue
# Re-attempt after fix
```

---

## Strategy 2: Gradual Rollout

**Best For:**
- Scale-ups (6-20 developers)
- Teams with moderate risk tolerance
- Environments with diverse feature complexity
- Teams wanting to validate before full commitment

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Pilot Program (Weeks 1-2)

**Week 1: Setup**

```bash
# Keep both commands available
# clarify.md = legacy (default)
# clarify-deep.md = deep review (opt-in)

# Add CLI support for --deep flag
# Edit src/specify_cli/__init__.py:
@app.command("clarify")
def clarify_command(
    args: str = "",
    deep: bool = typer.Option(False, "--deep"),
):
    if deep:
        template_path = "templates/commands/clarify-deep.md"
    else:
        template_path = "templates/commands/clarify.md"
    # Load and execute template
```

**Pilot Team Selection:**

Select 3-5 developers based on:
- ✅ Open to experimentation
- ✅ Working on new features (not maintenance)
- ✅ Mix of experience levels
- ✅ Features spanning complexity (simple → complex)

**Pilot Announcement Template:**

```markdown
## Deep Review Pilot Program

We're piloting an enhanced clarification workflow that uses AI reasoning to
catch issues early. We need 3-5 volunteers to try it on upcoming features.

### What You'll Do

1. Use `/speckit.clarify --deep` instead of regular `/speckit.clarify`
2. Track time and token cost
3. Rate question quality (1-5)
4. Note any issues or optimizations suggested
5. Fill out feedback form after feature completion

### Time Commitment

- 2-3 extra minutes per clarification session
- 10-minute feedback form at end

### Benefits for Pilots

- Early access to new features
- Influence final configuration
- Learn optimization patterns
- Help improve tool for whole team

### Sign Up

DM me or reply in #spec-kit channel by [date]
```

**Week 2: Execute Pilot**

For each pilot feature:
```bash
# Create spec as normal
/speckit.specify "feature description"

# Use deep review
/speckit.clarify --deep

# Fill out feedback form (see template below)
```

**Pilot Feedback Form Template:**

```markdown

[Your answer]
```

#### Phase 2: Analysis & Decision (Week 3)

**Aggregate Pilot Results:**

```python
# Simple analysis script
import pandas as pd

# Load feedback forms
df = pd.read_csv('pilot_feedback.csv')

# Calculate key metrics
print("=== Pilot Results ===")
print(f"Participants: {len(df)}")
print(f"Features tested: {df['feature_name'].nunique()}")
print(f"Avg token cost: {df['token_cost_actual'].mean():.0f}")
print(f"Avg time (seconds): {df['time_seconds'].mean():.0f}")
print(f"Avg question rating: {df['question_relevance'].mean():.1f}/5")
print(f"Avg overall rating: {df['overall_experience'].mean():.1f}/5")
print(f"\nWould use again:")
print(df['would_use_again'].value_counts())
print(f"\nIssues caught: {df['issues_caught'].sum()}")
print(f"Optimizations suggested: {df['optimizations_suggested'].sum()}")
```

**Decision Framework:**

```
If average_overall_rating >= 4.0 AND would_use_again >= 70%:
    → PROCEED to Phase 3 (Full Rollout)

Elif average_overall_rating >= 3.0 AND would_use_again >= 50%:
    → ITERATE (address feedback, extend pilot 2 weeks)

Else:
    → RECONSIDER (deep review may not be right fit)
```

#### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Weeks 4-6)

**Week 4: Preparation**

```bash
# Make deep review the default
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-legacy.md
mv clarify-deep.md clarify.md

# Update config with pilot learnings
# Edit .specify/config.yml based on pilot data:
# - Set default_mode to most common pilot preference
# - Tune auto_enable thresholds based on pilot feature complexity
# - Add domain patterns for frequent use cases
```

**Team Announcement (Full Rollout):**

```markdown
## 📣 Deep Review Clarification Now Default

Based on successful pilot results, deep review clarification is now the default
for all new features.

### Pilot Results

- **Features tested:** [N]
- **Average rating:** [X.X]/5.0
- **Would recommend:** [X]%
- **Issues caught:** [N] that legacy missed
- **Development time saved:** [X] hours total

### Key Learnings from Pilot

[Quote 2-3 specific examples from pilot feedback, e.g.:]
- "Deep review caught a circular dependency in tenant provisioning that would
  have required major refactoring during implementation." - [Name]
- "Optimization suggestion to use Auth0 instead of custom SSO saved us 4 weeks." - [Name]

### What This Means for You

Starting [date], `/speckit.clarify` uses deep review by default.

**For simple features** (CRUD, <10 requirements):
- Use `--fast` flag for legacy behavior
- Example: `/speckit.clarify --fast`

**For standard features** (most features):
- No flag needed, auto-detects mode
- Expect 60-120 seconds analysis

**For critical features** (auth, payment, multi-tenant):
- Use `--deep` flag for maximum analysis
- Expect 120-180 seconds analysis

### Training Session

[Date/Time]: 1-hour deep review training
- Live demo with real feature
- Q&A session
- Best practices

[Calendar invite link]

### Support

- Slack: #spec-kit
- Docs: docs/deep-review-configuration.md
- Office hours: [Time/day] with [Name]
```

**Week 5-6: Monitoring & Support**

Daily check-ins:
- Monitor #spec-kit channel for questions/issues
- Track adoption metrics
- Offer 1:1 support for struggling team members
- Collect ongoing feedback

#### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

**Configuration Tuning:**

Based on first month of full rollout:
```yaml
# Tune thresholds based on actual usage patterns
clarify:
  deep_review:
    # Adjust if too many simple features trigger deep review
    auto_enable:
      min_requirements: 18  # Tuned from 15
      min_complexity_score: 55  # Tuned from 50

    # Add custom domains discovered during rollout
    domain_patterns:
      # Real patterns from your codebase
      [custom_domain]:
        keywords: [...]
        questions: [...]
```

**Best Practices Documentation:**

## Strategy 3: Feature Flag Rollout

**Best For:**
- Enterprises (20+ developers)
- Teams with existing feature flag infrastructure
- Risk-averse organizations
- Distributed teams (gradual regional rollout)

### Implementation with LaunchDarkly/Split/Unleash

```python
# Example using LaunchDarkly
from ldclient import LDClient

# In clarify command
def should_use_deep_review(user_id, feature_context):
    ld_client = LDClient("your-sdk-key")

    flag_value = ld_client.variation(
        "deep-review-clarification",
        {
            "key": user_id,
            "custom": {
                "team": feature_context.team,
                "complexity": feature_context.complexity,
                "domain": feature_context.domain
            }
        },
        default=False  # Fallback to legacy
    )

    return flag_value
```

### Rollout Stages

**Stage 1: Internal Testing (Week 1-2)**
- 5% rollout to internal testing team
- Monitor metrics closely
- Fix any critical issues

**Stage 2: Pilot Teams (Week 3-4)**
- 25% rollout to selected teams
- Collect feedback
- Tune configuration

**Stage 3: Gradual Expansion (Week 5-8)**
- 50% rollout (half of teams)
- Monitor token costs at scale
- Validate ROI metrics

**Stage 4: Full Rollout (Week 9-12)**
- 100% rollout
- Remove feature flag (or keep for quick rollback)

### Feature Flag Configuration

```yaml
# LaunchDarkly flag configuration
name: deep-review-clarification
key: deep-review-clarification
kind: boolean
temporary: false  # Keep for long-term rollback capability

variations:
  - value: true
    name: "Deep Review Enabled"
  - value: false
    name: "Legacy Clarify"

targeting:
  rules:
    # Stage 1: Internal testing team
    - clauses:
        - attribute: team
          op: in
          values: ["platform", "internal-tools"]
      variation: 0  # Deep review
      rollout:
        percentage: 5

    # Stage 2: Pilot teams
    - clauses:
        - attribute: team
          op: in
          values: ["team-a", "team-b", "team-c"]
      variation: 0
      rollout:
        percentage: 25

    # Stage 3: Gradual expansion
    - clauses:
        - attribute: complexity
          op: in
          values: ["high", "critical"]
      variation: 0  # Always use deep review for complex features
      rollout:
        percentage: 100

  defaultRule:
    rollout:
      percentage: 0  # Start at 0%, gradually increase
```

---

## Strategy 4: Project-Based Adoption (Agency/Consultancy)

**Best For:**
- Agencies with multiple clients
- Consultancies billing by project
- Teams with varied project types

### Per-Project Decision Matrix

```
For each new project, evaluate:

Client Budget: [High/Medium/Low]
Project Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
Timeline: [Tight/Normal/Flexible]
Domain: [CRUD/Auth/Payment/Other]

Recommendation:
  If Budget=High AND (Complexity=Complex OR Domain=Auth/Payment):
      → Use deep review (thorough mode)
      → Bill analysis time to client
      → Highlight in proposal as value-add

  Elif Budget=Medium AND Complexity=Medium:
      → Use deep review (balanced mode)
      → Include in standard process

  Else:
      → Use legacy clarify
      → Offer deep review as upsell
```

### Client Proposal Language

```markdown
## Requirements Optimization (Optional Add-On)

Our enhanced requirements analysis uses AI-powered deep review to:
- Identify contradictions early (before development)
- Suggest optimizations that reduce scope 20-40%
- Catch security/compliance gaps
- Provide architecture recommendations

### Investment & ROI

- **Cost:** +$[X] or +[Y] hours
- **Typical Savings:** 15-30% reduction in development rework
- **Payback:** Usually recouped by end of development phase

### Example

Recent project: E-commerce checkout system
- **Deep review finding:** Recommended Stripe Billing over custom
- **Impact:** Saved 80 development hours ($12,000 value)
- **Investment:** 2 hours requirements analysis ($300)
- **ROI:** 40x return

### Recommendation

We recommend this for:
✓ Authentication/security features
✓ Payment integration
✓ Multi-tenant systems
✓ Complex business logic

Not recommended for:
✗ Simple CRUD operations
✗ Prototypes/MVPs with tight budgets
```

---

## Strategy 5: Open Source Project

**Best For:**
- Open source projects
- Volunteer-driven teams
- Distributed contributors

### Opt-In Documentation Approach

**README.md addition:**

```markdown
## Requirements Clarification

We use [spec-kit](https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit) for specification-driven development.

### Standard Clarify (Fast)

For simple features:
```bash
/speckit.clarify
```

### Deep Review (Optional)

For complex features, we offer optional deep review clarification:
```bash
/speckit.clarify --deep
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches contradictions and missing requirements
- Suggests optimizations
- Provides trade-off analysis for architecture decisions

**Trade-offs:**
- Takes 2-3 minutes longer
- Uses more tokens (if using paid AI)

**When to use:**
- Authentication/security features
- Payment integration
- Complex business logic
- Multi-tenant features

**When to skip:**
- Simple CRUD
- Bug fixes
- UI-only changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guide.
```

**CONTRIBUTING.md section:**

```markdown
## Feature Specification Process

### Step 1: Create Specification

```bash
/speckit.specify "Your feature description"
```

### Step 2: Clarify Requirements

Choose your clarification mode:

**Option A: Standard (Recommended for most features)**
```bash
/speckit.clarify
```
- Fast (30-60 seconds)
- Low token cost
- Good for simple features

**Option B: Deep Review (Recommended for complex/critical features)**
```bash
/speckit.clarify --deep
```
- Comprehensive analysis (60-180 seconds)
- Higher token cost
- Catches issues standard mode misses
- Use for: auth, payment, security, complex logic

Not sure which to use? Use standard mode. Maintainers will request deep review
if needed during PR review.
```

### Community Guidelines

- Document your choice in PR description
- If using deep review, mention issues it caught
- Share learnings in discussions
- Help tune configuration for common patterns

## Token Budget Planning

### Cost Models by Team Size

**Small Team (1-5 devs)**
```yaml
monthly_features: 10
avg_per_feature_tokens:
  legacy: 2000
  deep_review_balanced: 10000

monthly_token_cost:
  legacy_all: 20000  # 10 features × 2k
  deep_review_all: 100000  # 10 features × 10k
  hybrid:  # 5 simple + 5 complex
    simple_legacy: 10000  # 5 × 2k
    complex_deep: 50000   # 5 × 10k
    total: 60000

monthly_savings_estimated:
  deep_review_all: 150000  # 15k saved per feature × 10
  hybrid: 75000  # 15k saved × 5 complex features

net_roi:
  deep_review_all: +50000 tokens (1.5x)
  hybrid: +15000 tokens (1.25x)

recommendation: "Hybrid approach (deep for complex, legacy for simple)"
```

**Medium Team (6-20 devs)**
```yaml
monthly_features: 40
avg_per_feature_tokens:
  legacy: 2000
  deep_review_balanced: 10000

monthly_token_cost:
  legacy_all: 80000
  deep_review_all: 400000
  hybrid:  # 50% deep, 50% legacy
    simple_legacy: 40000
    complex_deep: 200000
    total: 240000

monthly_savings_estimated:
  deep_review_all: 600000  # 15k × 40
  hybrid: 300000  # 15k × 20

net_roi:
  deep_review_all: +200000 tokens (1.5x)
  hybrid: +60000 tokens (1.25x)

recommendation: "Hybrid with auto-detection, or deep review all"
```

### Budget Constraints Strategies

**Tight Budget (<100k tokens/month):**
```yaml
strategy: "Selective deep review"
rules:
  - Use legacy for: CRUD, UI-only, simple features
  - Use deep review for: Auth, payment, security, complex logic
  - Expected split: 80% legacy, 20% deep review
  - Est. monthly cost: 50k tokens
  - Est. savings: 75k tokens (1.5x ROI)
```

**Moderate Budget (100k-500k tokens/month):**
```yaml
strategy: "Auto-detection hybrid"
rules:
  - Use auto-detection (config determines mode)
  - Tune thresholds to hit budget
  - Expected split: 50% legacy, 50% deep review
  - Est. monthly cost: 150k tokens
  - Est. savings: 300k tokens (2x ROI)
```

**Flexible Budget (>500k tokens/month):**
```yaml
strategy: "Deep review by default"
rules:
  - Use deep review (balanced) for all features
  - Opt-out with --fast for truly simple features
  - Expected split: 80% deep review, 20% legacy
  - Est. monthly cost: 400k tokens
  - Est. savings: 600k tokens (1.5x ROI)
```

## Rollback & Contingency Planning

### Levels of Rollback

**Level 1: Individual Feature (Immediate)**
```bash
# User can opt-out per-feature
/speckit.clarify --fast  # Use legacy for this feature only
```
**Use when:** Single feature having issues, rest of team fine

---

**Level 2: User-Level (5 minutes)**
```yaml
# Add user-level override in config
clarify:
  user_overrides:
    john_doe: "legacy"  # Force legacy for specific user
    jane_smith: "balanced"  # Force balanced mode
```
**Use when:** Specific user/team having issues, others fine

---

**Level 3: Percentage Rollback (10 minutes)**
```yaml
# Reduce feature flag percentage
rollout:
  percentage: 25  # Down from 100
```
**Use when:** Widespread issues, but want to keep pilot users enabled

---

**Level 4: Full Rollback (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Restore legacy command
cd templates/commands
mv clarify.md clarify-deep-broken.md
mv clarify-legacy.md clarify.md
git add . && git commit -m "rollback: restore legacy clarify"
git push

# Notify team
# Post in #spec-kit: "Temporarily using legacy clarify due to [issue]. Will update when resolved."
```
**Use when:** Critical bug blocking all users

---

### Common Issues & Responses

| Issue | Severity | Response | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Token costs higher than expected** | Low | Tune config to reduce default mode | 1-2 days |
| **Analysis taking too long** | Medium | Reduce thresholds, or enable caching | 1 day |
| **Questions not relevant** | Medium | Add custom domain patterns | 2-3 days |
| **MCP server unavailable** | High | Fallback to legacy automatic | Immediate |
| **Spec updates incorrect** | High | Rollback to legacy, file bug | Immediate |
| **Team adoption resistance** | Medium | Additional training, extend pilot | 1-2 weeks |
