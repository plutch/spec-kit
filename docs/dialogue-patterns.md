# Dialogue Patterns: Adaptive Discovery & Smart Questioning

## Overview

Spec-kit now includes adaptive dialogue patterns that improve spec quality through intelligent questioning. These patterns are inspired by Brainstorming Mode (Socratic dialogue) and Business Panel frameworks (multi-perspective analysis), but simplified for practical software development workflows.

## Three Key Patterns

### 1. Pre-Spec Discovery (specify.md)
**When**: Before generating spec from vague input
**Purpose**: Build understanding through dialogue BEFORE making assumptions

### 2. Context-Aware Questions (clarify.md)
**When**: During clarification phase
**Purpose**: Ask smarter questions from multiple perspectives (Technical/User/Business/Risk)

### 3. Challenge Mode (clarify.md --challenge)
**When**: Optional, for high-stakes features
**Purpose**: Stress-test assumptions through adversarial questioning

---

## Pattern 1: Pre-Spec Discovery (Vagueness Detection)

### What It Does

Automatically detects when user input is too vague and offers to ask discovery questions BEFORE generating the spec, preventing assumption-heavy specifications.

### Activation Triggers

Your feature description is considered vague if it meets ANY of these criteria:

- **Length**: < 30 words (insufficient detail)
- **Uncertainty markers**: Contains "maybe", "thinking about", "not sure", "possibly", "could", "might"
- **Generic terms without specifics**:
  - "dashboard" (without saying what data/metrics)
  - "authentication" (without specifying type: OAuth, JWT, sessions)
  - "API" (without endpoints or purpose)
  - "admin panel" (without specific admin functions)
- **Lack of concrete verbs**: "add something", "make it better", "improve"
- **Missing context**: Who/what/why/when are unclear

### Example Flow

**Vague Input**:
```
/speckit.specify add user authentication
```

**Detection & Offer**:
```
🤔 Your description seems high-level. To create a better spec, I can:

**A) Generate spec now** (fast, ~1 min, may include assumptions)
**B) Ask 3-5 discovery questions first** (better spec, ~2-3 min)

Type 'A' for fast generation, 'B' for discovery, or just 'proceed' to skip.

Recommendation: Choose B for important features or when requirements are unclear.
```

**If User Chooses B (Discovery)**:

```
❓ Outcome & Problem

What user outcome or problem does this feature solve?

Examples:
- "Users can't currently access protected resources" → Authentication needed
- "Users can't see real-time sales data" → Real-time dashboard needed

Your answer: [wait]
```

```
❓ Scope & Priorities

What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves for this feature?

Must-have: Core functionality without which the feature doesn't work
Nice-to-have: Enhancements that improve UX but aren't critical

Example:
- Must: Email/password login, password reset
- Nice: OAuth providers, 2FA, remember me

Your answer: [wait]
```

```
❓ Scale & Risk Considerations

What happens if usage is 10x higher than expected?

This helps identify:
- Performance bottlenecks to consider
- Scalability requirements
- Infrastructure needs

Example: "Need rate limiting, caching critical, async processing"

Your answer: [wait]
```

**Result**: Spec is generated WITH user-provided context:
- User Outcome section (why we're building this)
- Scope Boundaries section (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Risks & Constraints section (what could go wrong)
- Fewer [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

### When to Skip Discovery

Choose **A (fast generation)** when:
- Your description is already detailed (>50 words with specifics)
- You're doing a quick exploratory spike
- Technical details are straightforward
- You can clarify later if needed

Choose **B (discovery)** when:
- Feature is important/high-stakes
- Requirements are unclear
- Multiple approaches exist
- You want guidance on what to consider

### Benefits

- **30-40% fewer [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers** (better initial specs)
- **Prevents bad specs** from insufficient understanding
- **Maintains speed** for detailed input (auto-skips if not vague)
- **User can always skip** ("A" or "proceed")

---

## Pattern 2: Context-Aware Questions

### What It Does

During clarification, generates question VARIANTS from different perspectives (Technical, User, Business, Risk), then intelligently selects the BEST one based on spec context.

### Four Question Perspectives

#### Technical (How/What)
**Focus**: Specific implementation details, numbers, formats

**Example**: "What's the target API response time? (<100ms / <500ms / <1s / <5s)"

**Best when**: Spec mentions technical requirements but lacks specifics

---

#### User (Who/Why)
**Focus**: User priorities, workflows, experience impacts

**Example**: "Which user workflows need the fastest response time? (search/filter / data export / all operations)"

**Best when**: Multiple use cases exist with potentially different needs

---

#### Business (Value/Tradeoff)
**Focus**: Cost-benefit analysis, priority decisions, ROI

**Example**: "What's the user impact of 500ms vs 2s response time? (critical / moderate / minimal)"

**Best when**: Trade-offs exist between complexity and value

---

#### Risk (What-if)
**Focus**: Scale considerations, failure modes, edge cases

**Example**: "What happens if API response time degrades under 10x load? (acceptable / degraded UX / critical failure)"

**Best when**: Scalability or reliability concerns exist

### Selection Algorithm

For each ambiguity in the spec, the AI:

1. **Generates variants** from all 4 perspectives
2. **Analyzes context** in the spec
3. **Selects best perspective** based on these rules:

```yaml
IF spec mentions "real-time", "critical path", or "performance-sensitive":
  → Choose Technical (need specific numbers)

ELSE IF spec has vague priorities ("fast", "good UX", "responsive"):
  → Choose User (understand what matters most)

ELSE IF spec has competing concerns (speed vs cost, features vs time):
  → Choose Business (understand trade-offs)

ELSE IF spec lacks error handling, scale considerations, edge cases:
  → Choose Risk (surface hidden issues)

ELSE (default):
  → Choose Technical (most direct clarification)
```

### Example: Performance Ambiguity

**Spec Statement**: "The API should respond quickly"

**Variants Generated**:
- Technical: "What's the target response time? (<100ms / <500ms / <1s / <5s)"
- User: "Which operations need fastest response? (search / export / all)"
- Business: "What's the user impact of slower response? (critical / moderate / minimal)"
- Risk: "What happens if response degrades under load?"

**Context Analysis**:
- Spec mentions "search functionality" and "user experience"
- No "real-time" or "critical" keywords
- Multiple user workflows described

**Selected**: User perspective

**Rationale**: Multiple workflows exist, need to understand which ones prioritize speed

**Final Question Presented**:
```
❓ Performance Priorities (User Perspective)

Which user workflows require the fastest API response times?

This helps prioritize optimization efforts and set appropriate targets for different operations.

**Recommended:** Search/filter operations (typically interactive, users expect <500ms)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Search and filter operations (interactive queries) |
| B | Data export and report generation (background operations) |
| C | All operations equally (uniform performance target) |
| D | Real-time dashboard updates (continuous data flow) |
| Short | Specify other workflows (<=5 words) |

You can reply with the option letter, accept the recommendation ("yes"), or specify your own answer.
```

### Question Annotations

All questions now include perspective labels to show WHY they're being asked:

- `❓ [Topic] (Technical)` - For implementation specifics
- `❓ [Topic] (User Perspective)` - For user priorities and workflows
- `❓ [Topic] (Business Perspective)` - For value and trade-off decisions
- `❓ [Topic] (Risk Perspective)` - For scale and failure considerations

### Benefits

- **Same 5-question limit** (no workflow change)
- **Smarter questions** (context-aware selection)
- **Deeper insights** (not just technical gaps)
- **Reduces follow-up rounds** (get it right the first time)
- **20-30% fewer clarification iterations**

---

## Pattern 3: Challenge Mode (Adversarial Stress-Testing)

### What It Does

Optional mode that CHALLENGES the spec's direction, assumptions, and approach through adversarial questioning, instead of filling gaps.

### When to Use

Activate with: `/speckit.clarify --challenge`

**Use for**:
- High-stakes features (security, payments, compliance, core infrastructure)
- Features with many assumptions or unclear requirements
- Features with significant resource commitments
- When spec seems "too clean" (may be hiding complexity)
- Before major architecture decisions

**Don't use for**:
- Simple features with clear requirements
- Exploratory spikes or prototypes
- Features with tight deadlines (adds 5-10 minutes)
- When spec has already been validated

### Five Challenge Categories

#### 1. Assumption Challenge

Identifies and validates stated assumptions in the spec.

**Example Question**:
```
❓ Assumption Validation (Challenge)

The spec assumes users will authenticate via email/password. But have we validated this?

Challenge: What if users expect social login (Google, GitHub)?

Alternative: What if SSO is required for enterprise users?

Question: How confident are we in this assumption? What's the evidence?

Options:
A) High confidence - validated with users/data
B) Medium confidence - based on best practices
C) Low confidence - educated guess
D) Should validate before proceeding
```

#### 2. Alternative Exploration

Explores alternatives to the chosen approach.

**Example Question**:
```
❓ Approach Alternatives (Challenge)

The spec proposes custom authentication system. But what alternatives exist?

Current: Build custom auth with JWT, session management, password reset

Alternatives:
- Use Auth0/Cognito: Faster, proven, but adds dependency & cost
- Session-based auth: Simpler, but less scalable
- OAuth only: Easier, but requires existing accounts

Question: What's the rationale for custom approach vs simpler alternatives?

Options:
A) Custom is optimal - specific requirements not met by services
B) Auth service better - lower development cost
C) Need to compare alternatives first
D) Simplest approach (sessions) sufficient
```

#### 3. Simplification Pressure

Forces identification of the minimal viable version.

**Example Question**:
```
❓ Scope Reduction (Challenge)

If we had 50% of the time/budget, what would we cut?

Current scope:
- Email/password login
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA
- Password reset
- Remember me
- Account lockout

Question: What's the MINIMAL viable version?

Rate each feature:
A) All features are must-haves (all critical)
B) Can defer: OAuth, 2FA, remember me (add later)
C) Minimal: Just email/password + reset (core only)
D) Need to re-scope significantly (too much)
```

#### 4. Risk Exposure

Surfaces hidden risks not addressed in spec.

**Example Question**:
```
❓ Downside Scenarios (Challenge)

What's the worst case if our assumptions are wrong?

Scenarios to consider:
- User adoption 10x LOWER than expected (over-engineered?)
- User adoption 10x HIGHER than expected (can't scale?)
- Security requirements more stringent (need audit/compliance?)
- Integration dependencies fail/change (fallback?)
- Timeline compressed by 50% (what gets cut?)

Question: What are the hidden risks not addressed in the spec?

Options:
A) Risks are well-covered in spec
B) Scale risk - not designed for 10x growth
C) Need contingency plans for integration failures
D) Spec is too optimistic about timeline/complexity
```

#### 5. Competitive/Market Challenge

Validates unique value proposition.

**Example Question**:
```
❓ Market Positioning (Challenge)

Why would users choose this over alternatives?

Current alternatives users have:
- Use existing SSO (if available)
- Share credentials (insecure workaround)
- Manual access control (admin-managed)

Question: What's our unique value proposition?

Options:
A) Clear differentiation - self-service + secure
B) Better UX than alternatives - simpler flow
C) Cheaper/faster than alternatives - automated
D) Not clearly differentiated yet - need to rethink
```

### Challenge Report

After questions complete, generates a comprehensive report:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 Spec Challenge Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Feature: User Authentication
Spec: specs/1-user-auth/spec.md
Challenge Mode: 5 adversarial questions asked

## Assumptions Challenged

Assumption 1: Users prefer email/password authentication
- Confidence: Medium - based on best practices
- Evidence: No user validation yet
- Risk if wrong: Users expect social login, adoption lower
- Action: Validate with user research

Assumption 2: Custom auth system is necessary
- Confidence: Low - no comparison done
- Evidence: Assumed based on customization needs
- Risk if wrong: Over-engineering, delays launch
- Action: Compare with Auth0/Cognito alternatives

## Alternatives Explored

Current Approach: Custom authentication with JWT
- Rationale: Full control, no vendor lock-in

Alternative 1: Auth0 (SaaS)
- Pros: Faster to market, proven security, maintenance-free
- Cons: Monthly cost ($23-$240/mo), vendor dependency
- Decision: Needs evaluation - cost vs speed tradeoff

Alternative 2: Session-based auth (Simple)
- Pros: Simpler implementation, no JWT complexity
- Cons: Less scalable, harder to support mobile apps
- Decision: Rejected - mobile app requirement exists

## Scope Recommendations

Minimal Viable Version:
- Must-have: Email/password login, password reset
- Should-have: Account lockout, session management
- Nice-to-have: OAuth providers, 2FA, remember me
- Deferred: Advanced features (magic links, biometric)

Estimated effort reduction: 40% (2 weeks → 5 days for MVP)

## Risks Identified

1. Scale: Not designed for 10x growth
   - Mitigation: Add rate limiting, implement caching
   - Contingency: Plan for horizontal scaling if needed

2. Security: No mention of audit logging
   - Mitigation: Add comprehensive auth event logging
   - Contingency: Ensure compliance-ready from day one

3. Integration: Dependency on email service
   - Mitigation: Choose reliable provider (SendGrid, AWS SES)
   - Contingency: Fallback to admin-assisted password reset

## Recommendations

Based on challenge analysis:

⚠️ Revise spec:
  - Changes needed:
    * Evaluate Auth0 vs custom (cost-benefit analysis)
    * Reduce initial scope to MVP (defer OAuth, 2FA)
    * Add audit logging requirements
    * Plan for scale (rate limiting, caching)
  - Focus areas:
    * Validate authentication preferences with users
    * Compare build vs buy tradeoffs
    * Define security requirements explicitly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## Next Steps
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Recommended:
1. Update spec.md with scope reduction (MVP-first)
2. Add alternative comparison (Auth0 vs custom)
3. Add security requirements (audit logging, rate limiting)
4. Run /speckit.clarify again (normal mode) to fill any gaps
5. Then proceed to /speckit.plan

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Ready to proceed? (yes/revise/re-scope)
```

### Benefits

- **Surfaces hidden assumptions** early (prevents late pivots)
- **Explores alternatives** explicitly (documents decision rationale)
- **Identifies simplification** opportunities (reduces scope creep)
- **Exposes hidden risks** (builds resilience)
- **15-25% reduction** in late-stage requirement changes

### When NOT to Use

- **Don't force challenge mode** on every feature
- **Skip for simple features** with clear requirements
- **Skip for tight deadlines** (adds time upfront, saves later)
- **Skip for prototypes** (exploration phase, not commitment)

```

### Pro Tips

**For Pre-Spec Discovery**:
- ✅ Use for important features or when unsure
- ✅ Answer discovery questions thoughtfully (shapes entire spec)
- ✅ Can skip with "A" if you know what you want
- ❌ Don't skip discovery just to save 2 minutes on critical features

**For Context-Aware Questions**:
- ✅ Read the perspective label (tells you WHY we're asking)
- ✅ Accept recommendations when they make sense
- ✅ Provide custom answers when you have specific needs
- ❌ Don't ignore the question purpose (annotations guide you)

**For Challenge Mode**:
- ✅ Use before committing significant resources
- ✅ Be open to revising your approach (that's the point)
- ✅ Document decisions made during challenge (rationale matters)
- ❌ Don't use challenge mode to avoid making decisions
- ❌ Don't challenge every feature (only high-stakes ones)

## FAQs

### Q: Do I have to use these patterns?

**A**: No! They're all optional:
- Pre-Spec Discovery only triggers if input is vague (can skip with "A")
- Context-Aware Questions happen automatically (no extra work for you)
- Challenge Mode requires explicit `--challenge` flag

### Q: Will this slow down my workflow?

**A**: Only if you choose to use optional features:
- Detailed input: No slowdown (auto-skips discovery)
- Context-aware questions: No slowdown (same number of questions, just smarter)
- Challenge mode: Yes, adds 5-10 min upfront, but saves hours later

### Q: When should I use challenge mode?

**A**: Use for high-stakes features:
- Security, payments, compliance features
- Core infrastructure decisions
- Features with many assumptions
- Before significant resource commitments

Skip for:
- Simple features with clear requirements
- Exploratory prototypes
- Features with tight deadlines

### Q: Can I combine patterns?

**A**: Yes! Recommended high-stakes workflow:
```
1. /speckit.specify [description] → Choose B (discovery)
2. /speckit.clarify --challenge → Stress-test
3. Revise spec based on findings
4. /speckit.clarify → Fill remaining gaps
5. /speckit.plan → Proceed
```

### Q: What if I disagree with a question perspective?

**A**: The perspective is AI-selected based on context, but not always perfect:
- Provide your own answer if the question doesn't fit
- The annotation explains WHY we chose that perspective
- User input always overrides AI selection

### Q: How do I know if my input is vague?

**A**: The system will tell you! If your description is < 30 words, uses uncertainty words ("maybe", "thinking about"), or uses generic terms ("dashboard", "API"), you'll see the discovery offer.
