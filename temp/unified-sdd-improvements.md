# Unified SDD Methodology - Improvement Opportunities
## Review of /home/localdev/work/spec-kit/temp/unified-sdd-methodology.md

**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Reviewer**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Document Version**: 1.0
**Review Scope**: Clarity, Completeness, Actionability, User Experience

---

## Executive Summary

The unified methodology document is **philosophically sound and comprehensive** (1036 lines, ~27,000 words), but suffers from **density and missing practical guidance**. While it successfully merges Adaptive SDD and Business Rules, it lacks quick-reference materials, decision trees, end-to-end examples, and anti-patterns that would make it actionable for practitioners. The document is optimized for thorough review but not for day-to-day use. Key improvements needed: (1) Add executive summary with visual workflow, (2) Include decision trees for when to use each component, (3) Provide complete end-to-end walkthrough example, (4) Add FAQ and glossary sections, (5) Create anti-patterns guide, (6) Fix terminology inconsistencies identified in alignment review.

**Readability Score**: 6/10 (comprehensive but dense)
**Actionability Score**: 7/10 (clear tasks but missing decision support)
**Completeness Score**: 8/10 (thorough but missing practical examples)

## Critical Improvements (HIGH Priority - Block Implementation)

### 1. Add Governance Approval Gate to Phase 1 ⚠️ **BLOCKER**

**Issue**: Constitutional amendment (Article XI) requires stakeholder approval per canonical Spec Kit, but Phase 1 doesn't include approval prerequisite.

**Current Text** (lines 542-552):
```markdown
### Phase 1: Constitutional Updates (Week 1)

**File**: `memory/constitution.md`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **T1.1**: Add Article XI: Technical Pivot Protocol (7 sections)
- [ ] **T1.2**: Update Article III reference in Article XI.4 (Test-First Imperative)
- [ ] **T1.3**: Add cross-reference to `.specify/business-rules/validation-rules.md`
- [ ] **T1.4**: Version bump constitution (v2.0 → v2.1)
```

**Recommended Change**:
```markdown
### Milestone 1: Constitutional Updates (Week 1-2) - REQUIRES APPROVAL

**GOVERNANCE PREREQUISITE (CRITICAL)**:

Constitutional amendments require formal stakeholder approval per canonical Spec Kit:
"Constitutional principles are immutable unless formally amended through documented review"

**Approval Process**:
- [ ] **T1.0**: Obtain Constitutional Amendment Approval (Week 1)
  - **Action**: Present unified-sdd-methodology.md to stakeholders
  - **Stakeholders**: Architecture team, product leadership, engineering leads
  - **Decision Criteria**:
    - Does Article XI align with project needs?
    - Is the 7-week implementation timeline acceptable?
    - Are there resource/budget constraints?
  - **Approval Artifact**: Create ADR-000 or update CHANGELOG.md with decision
  - **Required Signatures**: [Architecture Lead], [Product VP], [CTO]
  - **Timeline**: 1 week for review + decision
  - **BLOCKER**: Implementation cannot proceed without approval

**Implementation Tasks** (Week 2, after approval):
- [ ] **T1.1**: Add Article XI: Technical Pivot Protocol (7 sections)
- [ ] **T1.2**: Update Article III reference in Article XI.4
- [ ] **T1.3**: Add cross-reference to validation-rules.md
- [ ] **T1.4**: Version bump constitution (v2.0 → v2.1)
- [ ] **T1.5**: Announce approval to engineering team

**Deliverable**: Approved and implemented constitutional amendment
**Timeline**: 2 weeks total (1 week approval + 1 week implementation)
```

**Impact**: +1 week to timeline, changes Phase 1 from Week 1 → Weeks 1-2

---

### 2. Fix Terminology Inconsistency (Phase → Milestone) ⚠️ **HIGH**

**Issue**: Document uses "Phase 1-8" for implementation roadmap, conflicts with SDD workflow phases (Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implementation).

**Occurrences**:
- Line 128-197: "Phase 1: SPECIFY", "Phase 2: CONSTRAIN", etc. (workflow phases - CORRECT)
- Line 540-720: "Phase 1: Constitutional Updates", "Phase 2: Template Consolidation" (implementation milestones - INCORRECT)
- Line 1004-1015: "Phase 1... Phase 8" (implementation order - INCORRECT)

**Recommended Change**:

**Global Find/Replace**:
1. "Phase 1: Constitutional Updates" → "Milestone 1: Constitutional Updates"
2. "Phase 2: Template Consolidation" → "Milestone 2: Template Consolidation"
3. ... through Phase 8

**Add Disambiguation Note** at line 540 (before "Integration Tasks"):
```markdown
## Integration Tasks (Implementation Roadmap)

**IMPORTANT - TERMINOLOGY NOTE**:
The following 8 **milestones** describe the implementation roadmap for building the unified SDD infrastructure.
These milestones are DISTINCT from the 7 SDD **workflow phases** (Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement)
that projects use after the infrastructure is built.

- **Implementation Milestones** (Milestone 1-8): Building the system (this roadmap)
- **SDD Workflow Phases** (Phase 1-7): Using the system (day-to-day development)

### Milestone 1: Constitutional Updates (Week 1-2) - REQUIRES APPROVAL
...
```

**Impact**: 30-60 minutes for find/replace, critical for clarity

---

## High-Impact Improvements (Enhance Usability)

### 3. Add Executive Summary with Visual Workflow 📊

**Issue**: Document is 1036 lines with no quick-reference summary. New users need 5-minute overview.

**Location**: Insert after line 8 (after document header, before current "Alignment Summary")

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## 📋 Quick Start (5-Minute Overview)

**What is Unified SDD?**
Spec-Driven Development enhanced with two optional systems:
1. **Adaptive Pivots**: Handle architectural blockers via TECHNICAL.md + ADRs
2. **Business Rules**: Capture/validate business logic via harvest/extract commands

**When Should I Use This?**
- ✅ **Use Adaptive SDD** when: Multi-tenant systems, high-performance requirements, complex architecture, unknown framework limitations
- ✅ **Use Business Rules** when: Complex business logic, regulatory compliance, multi-feature rule sharing, LLM-assisted development
- ❌ **Skip both** when: Simple CRUD features, well-known tech stack, single-tenant apps

**Visual Workflow**:

```

**Impact**: Reduces onboarding time from 2 hours → 15 minutes

---

### 4. Add Decision Trees 🌳

**Issue**: Engineers don't know when to use TECHNICAL.md, when to create ADR, or where to place ADR.

**Location**: Insert new section after "Unified Directory Structure" (after line 305)

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## Decision Trees (Quick Reference)

### Decision Tree 1: Should I Create TECHNICAL.md?

```
START: New feature spec written (spec.md exists)
  ↓
  ├─ Is this a CRUD feature with known tech stack?
  │    YES → Skip TECHNICAL.md, proceed to /plan
  │    NO  ↓
  │
  ├─ Does feature involve ANY of these?
  │    • Multi-tenancy or sharding
  │    • Performance targets (P95 <250ms, >1000 RPS)
  │    • New/untested framework combinations
  │    • Regulatory/compliance constraints
  │    • Architectural unknowns [NEEDS VALIDATION]
  │
  │    YES → CREATE TECHNICAL.md ✅
  │    NO  → Skip TECHNICAL.md
  │
  └─ Result: If created, fill TECHNICAL.md BEFORE running /plan
```

**Example Prompts in create-new-feature.sh**:
```bash
echo "Feature complexity assessment:"
read -p "Multi-tenant or sharding? (y/N): " MULTI_TENANT
read -p "Performance targets <250ms? (y/N): " PERF_TARGET
read -p "New/untested framework? (y/N): " NEW_FRAMEWORK
read -p "Regulatory/compliance? (y/N): " COMPLIANCE

if [[ $MULTI_TENANT =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] || [[ $PERF_TARGET =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] || \
   [[ $NEW_FRAMEWORK =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] || [[ $COMPLIANCE =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "✅ Creating TECHNICAL.md (complex feature detected)"
    cp templates/adaptive/technical-constraints-template.md \
       specs/$FEATURE_DIR/TECHNICAL.md
else
    echo "ℹ️  Skipping TECHNICAL.md (simple feature)"
fi
```

---

### Decision Tree 2: Should I Create an ADR?

```
START: Problem encountered during implementation
  ↓
  ├─ Is this a BUG (code-level fix)?
  │    YES → Fix code, no ADR needed
  │    NO  ↓
  │
  ├─ Can I work around this while maintaining requirements?
  │    YES → Implement workaround, document in plan.md comments
  │    NO  ↓
  │
  ├─ Does this require changing:
  │    • Database strategy (Prisma → pg, SQL → NoSQL)
  │    • Framework/ORM choice
  │    • Architectural pattern (REST → GraphQL, monolith → microservices)
  │    • Security model (session → JWT)
  │
  │    YES → CREATE ADR ✅
  │    NO  → Document decision in TECHNICAL.md amendments
  │
  └─ ADR Required ✅ → Proceed to Decision Tree 3
```

---

### Decision Tree 3: Where Should I Place the ADR?

```
START: ADR needed (from Decision Tree 2)
  ↓
  ├─ Was blocker discovered DURING a specific feature implementation?
  │    YES ↓
  │    │
  │    ├─ Does this decision affect OTHER features or the entire architecture?
  │    │    YES → .specify/decisions/adr-###-title.md (cross-project)
  │    │    NO  → specs/###-feature/decisions/adr-###-title.md (feature-scoped)
  │    │
  │    NO (blocker discovered during architecture/planning phase)
  │    └─ .specify/decisions/adr-###-title.md (cross-project)
  │
  └─ ADR Placement Determined ✅
```

**Relocation Rule**:
If an ADR starts feature-scoped but later affects multiple features:
1. Move: `specs/001-feature/decisions/adr-002.md` → `.specify/decisions/adr-002.md`
2. Update references in all `TECHNICAL.md` files
3. Add note to original location: `# RELOCATED: See .specify/decisions/adr-002.md`

---

### Decision Tree 4: Should I Use Business Rules System?

```
START: Feature involves business logic
  ↓
  ├─ Does feature have ANY of these characteristics?
  │    • Complex conditional logic (>3 nested conditions)
  │    • Regulatory/compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI, HIPAA)
  │    • Business rules shared across multiple features
  │    • Frequent rule changes (quarterly/monthly updates)
  │    • LLM agents need to query business logic
  │    • Audit trail requirements (SOX, FDA)
  │
  │    YES → USE BUSINESS RULES ✅
  │    │     → Run /rules-harvest during /plan phase
  │    │     → Add @BusinessRule annotations during implementation
  │    │     → Run /rules-extract after implementation
  │    │
  │    NO  → Document logic in plan.md, skip Business Rules system
  │
  └─ Result: Business Rules system is OPTIONAL enhancement
```

---
```

**Impact**: Reduces decision time from 30 minutes → 2 minutes per question

---

### 5. Add Complete End-to-End Walkthrough Example 📖

**Issue**: Document has scattered examples but no single complete walkthrough showing all systems working together.

**Location**: Insert new section after "Interaction Points" (after line 537)

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## Complete End-to-End Example

This walkthrough demonstrates the unified methodology with a real-world scenario: **Multi-Company Warehouse Zones Feature with Prisma Pivot**.

### Scenario Setup

**Product Requirement**: "Support 600,000 companies with zone-based inventory management, <250ms P95 latency"

**Tech Context**:
- Existing codebase uses Prisma ORM for platform database
- Multi-tenant architecture: 300 companies per PostgreSQL shard
- Schema-per-company isolation strategy

**Team**: 2 engineers, 1 architect, 1 PM

---

### Step 1: Create Non-Technical Spec (Week 1, Day 1)

**Command**: `specify init 001-multi-company-zones --ai claude`

**File Created**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md`

```markdown
# Feature: Multi-Company Warehouse Zones

## User Story
**As a** warehouse manager
**I want** to organize inventory by zones within each company
**So that** I can track capacity and optimize picking routes

## Success Criteria
- Create/update/delete zones per company
- Assign inventory items to zones
- Generate zone capacity reports
- Support 300 companies per database shard

## Performance Targets
- Zone lookup: <50ms P95
- Capacity calculation: <200ms for 10k items
- Overall system latency: <250ms P95

## Acceptance Tests
- [TESTABLE] POST /api/companies/{slug}/zones creates zone
- [TESTABLE] GET /api/companies/{slug}/zones lists all zones
- [TESTABLE] Zone capacity report generated in <200ms
```

**Note**: No mention of Prisma, pg, or ORM strategy (non-technical spec ✅)

---

### Step 2: Create Technical Constraints (Week 1, Day 1)

**Decision**: Feature involves multi-tenancy + performance targets → Use Decision Tree 1 → CREATE TECHNICAL.md ✅

**Command**: `cp templates/adaptive/technical-constraints-template.md specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md`

**File Created**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md`

```markdown
# Technical Constraints: Multi-Company Zones

## Architecture (Known Constraints)

### Database
- **Platform**: Neon PostgreSQL (central tenant/auth data)
- **Shards**: 300 companies per shard, schema-per-company isolation
- **ORM**: Prisma Client (assumption: works with schema isolation)
- **Connection**: Hyperdrive connection pooling

### Multi-Tenancy Pattern
- Use `withCompany(env, companySlug, async ({ prisma, client }) => ...)`
- MUST include `company_id` in all WHERE clauses
- Schema switching via `SET search_path TO '{companySlug}_schema'`

### Performance Targets
- Zone CRUD operations: <50ms P95
- Capacity calculations: <200ms for 10k items
- Overall P95: <250ms

### Constitutional Constraints
- Article VII (Simplicity): Maximum 3 projects for initial implementation
- Article VIII (Anti-Abstraction): Use Prisma features directly, no wrappers
- Article IX (Integration-First): Contract tests required before implementation

### Uncertain Risks (Early Validation Required)
- [ ] [NEEDS VALIDATION: Prisma performance with 300 schemas per database]
- [ ] [NEEDS VALIDATION: Schema switching overhead with Prisma adapter]
- [ ] [NEEDS VALIDATION: Migration complexity for 300 schemas]

## Decision Points
**IF** Prisma causes issues (P95 >250ms or schema conflicts):
→ PIVOT to pure node-postgres (requires ADR + spec amendment)
```

---

### Step 3: Harvest Business Rules (Week 1, Day 2)

**Command**: `/rules-harvest`

**File Created**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/rules/harvest.md`

```markdown
# Business Rules Harvest: Multi-Company Zones

**Feature**: Multi-Company Zones
**Spec**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md`
**Harvested**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: All rules are DRAFT (finalize during implementation)

---

## BR-ZONES-001: Max Capacity Per Zone (DRAFT)

**Priority**: HIGH
**Domain**: ZONES
**Source**: FR-001
**Tenant Scope**: PER_TENANT  ← Auto-filled from TECHNICAL.md

### Given
- Zone exists in company warehouse
- Zone has max_capacity field (e.g., 10,000 units)
- Current inventory count < max_capacity

### When
- Warehouse manager attempts to move inventory to zone
- New inventory count would exceed max_capacity

### Then
- Reject inventory movement
- Return error: "Zone {zone_name} exceeds capacity"
- Log capacity violation event

### Otherwise
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: Can admin override capacity limit?
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: Alert threshold (e.g., warn at 90%)?

### Next Steps
- [ ] Clarify override/alert logic
- [ ] Write tests BEFORE implementation (Article VI)
- [ ] Add @BusinessRule annotation during implementation
- [ ] Run /rules-extract after implementation
```

---

### Step 4: Generate Plan (Week 1, Day 2)

**Command**: `/plan`

**LLM Reads**:
1. `memory/constitution.md` (Articles I-XI)
2. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md` (user value)
3. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md` (constraints)
4. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/rules/harvest.md` (business logic)

**File Generated**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/plan.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Multi-Company Zones

## Phase -1: Constitutional Validation

- [x] Article VII (Simplicity): Using ≤3 projects? YES (zones lib, API, tests)
- [x] Article VIII (Anti-Abstraction): Using Prisma directly? YES
- [x] Article IX (Integration-First): Contract tests defined? YES
- [x] Article XI (Pivot Protocol): TECHNICAL.md risks flagged? YES (3 [NEEDS VALIDATION])

## Phase 0: Prerequisites

- Database schema for zones table (platform + shard template)
- Prisma schema updated for Zone model
- withCompany() pattern verified with Prisma adapter

## Phase 1-6: [Full implementation plan generated...]

## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk**: Prisma performance with 300 schemas (flagged in TECHNICAL.md)
**Validation**: Week 3, contract testing phase - measure actual P95 latency
**Contingency**: If P95 >250ms, escalate via Article XI pivot protocol
```

---

### Step 5: Implement (Week 2-4)

Engineers follow `tasks.md` sequentially, writing tests first:

**Week 2**: Zone CRUD operations with Prisma
**Week 3**: Contract testing phase
**Week 4**: Capacity calculation logic

---

### Step 6: BLOCKER DISCOVERED (Week 3, Day 3) 🔥

**Scenario**: During contract testing, P95 latency = 450ms (target: <250ms)

**Root Cause**: Prisma adapter + `SET search_path` creates 4-layer abstraction (Prisma → Adapter → Pool → Hyperdrive) causing metadata mismatches

**Error**: `relation 'zones' does not exist` despite correct schema switching

---

### Step 7: Create ADR (Week 3, Day 3)

**Decision Tree 2**: Is this a bug? NO. Can I work around? NO. Requires architectural change? YES → CREATE ADR ✅

**Decision Tree 3**: Discovered during feature implementation? YES. Affects other features? YES (all company shard operations) → `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-pg.md` ✅

**Command**: `/create-adr`

**File Created**: `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md`

```markdown
# ADR-002: Migrate to Pure node-postgres for Shard Operations

## Status
ACCEPTED (2025-01-23)

## Context
During contract testing of multi-company zones (Week 3):
- Prisma Client with @prisma/adapter-pg failed to respect `SET search_path`
- 4-layer abstraction (Prisma→Adapter→Pool→Hyperdrive) creates metadata mismatches
- P95 latency: 450ms (target: <250ms)
- Error: `relation 'zones' does not exist` despite correct schema switching

## Decision
**Migrate company shard operations from Prisma to pure node-postgres**:
- FROM: Prisma Client + @prisma/adapter-pg for all database operations
- TO: Prisma for Platform DB (stable schema) + pg Pool for Shards (dynamic schemas)
- SCOPE: All company-level operations (withCompany pattern)
- RATIONALE: Eliminates abstraction layers, provides direct SQL control, reduces P95 to <150ms

## Constitutional Compliance

### Article VII: Simplicity Gate
- [x] Using ≤3 projects? YES (Platform DB still uses Prisma)
- [x] No future-proofing? YES (solving current blocker only)

### Article VIII: Anti-Abstraction Gate
- [⚠️] Creating SQL helpers abstraction layer
- **Exception**: Approved - Minimal CRUD helpers to reduce boilerplate, no ORM-like abstractions
- **Mitigation**: Keep helpers <200 LOC, direct SQL passthrough

### Article IX: Integration-First Gate
- [x] Contract tests updated? YES (see specs/001-multi-company-zones/contracts/)
- [x] Tests FAIL with current implementation? YES (verified)
- [x] Using real databases? YES

## Consequences

### Positive
- P95 latency: 450ms → <150ms (66% improvement)
- Eliminates metadata conflicts (zero "table not exist" errors)
- Direct SQL control for complex queries
- No Prisma regeneration when switching environments

### Negative
- Lose Prisma type safety for company operations
- Manual query construction (more boilerplate)
- Need custom migration runner for 300 schemas
- 3-4 week migration timeline before feature work continues

### Mitigation
- Use Zod schemas for runtime type validation
- Create SQL helper library (sql-helpers.ts) for common CRUD
- Implement custom migration runner (db-migration-strategy.md)
- Maintain Prisma for Platform DB to preserve type safety there

## Affected Business Rules

### Modified Rules
- **BR-ZONES-001**: Max Capacity Per Zone
  - **Test Change**:
    - FROM: `tests/zones/test_max_capacity.py:52` (Prisma contracts)
    - TO: `tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py:52` (pg contracts)
  - **Implementation Change**:
    - FROM: `src/zones/prisma-service.ts:142` (Prisma)
    - TO: `src/zones/pg-service.ts:67` (pg Pool)
  - **Action**: Update catalog via `/rules-extract --module ZONES`
  - **Constitutional Impact**: Article VI (Test-First) - tests updated before implementation ✅

## Implementation Plan
See: specs/001-multi-company-zones/migration-plan.md
Timeline: 3-4 weeks (prerequisite before zones feature completion)
```

---

### Step 8: Amend TECHNICAL.md (Week 3, Day 3)

**Command**: `/amend-technical specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md`

**File Updated**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md`

```markdown
# Technical Constraints: Multi-Company Zones

## ~~Architecture (Known Constraints)~~ → AMENDED (2025-01-23)

### Database (UPDATED)
- **Platform**: Neon PostgreSQL (central tenant/auth data) - **Uses Prisma** ✅
- **Shards**: 300 companies per shard, schema-per-company isolation - **Uses pg Pool** ⚠️ CHANGED
- ~~**ORM**: Prisma Client~~ → **REPLACED**: Pure node-postgres for shards (ADR-002)
- **Connection**: Hyperdrive connection pooling

### Multi-Tenancy Pattern (UPDATED)
- Platform: `withPlatform(env, async ({ prisma }) => ...)` ← Prisma ✅
- Shards: `withCompany(env, companySlug, async ({ client }) => ...)` ← Raw SQL ⚠️ CHANGED
- MUST include `company_id` in all WHERE clauses
- Schema switching via `SET search_path TO '{companySlug}_schema'`

### Decision History
- **ADR-002** (2025-01-23): Migrated to pure pg for shards (Prisma multi-schema blocker)
  - Trigger: Prisma adapter + schema switching = 450ms P95 latency + metadata conflicts
  - Impact: 3-4 week implementation delay, loses type safety, gains 66% latency improvement
  - Status: ACCEPTED, implementation in progress (Week 4-7)
```

---

### Step 9: Regenerate Plan (Week 3, Day 4)

**Command**: `/plan --regenerate`

**LLM Reads** (updated inputs):
1. `memory/constitution.md` (Articles I-XI)
2. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md` (unchanged)
3. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md` (**AMENDED 2025-01-23**)
4. `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md` (**NEW**)
5. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/rules/harvest.md`

**File Regenerated**: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/plan.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Multi-Company Zones

## Updated Context (2025-01-23)
**Technical Pivot**: ADR-002 requires migrating to pure node-postgres for shard operations
before implementing zones feature.

## Prerequisites (ADDED - From ADR-002)
1. ✅ Complete pure-pg migration (pure-pg-implementation-plan.md) - **3-4 weeks**
2. ✅ Implement custom migration runner (db-migration-strategy.md) - **2 weeks**
3. ✅ Create SQL helper library (sql-helpers.ts) - **1 week**

## Phase 0: Pure pg Migration (Week 4-7) ← NEW PREREQUISITE
[40 tasks for Prisma → pg migration]

## Phase 1-6: Zones Feature (Week 8-13) ← DELAYED
[Original phases continue with updated database patterns using pg Pool]

## Updated Timeline
- Original estimate: 6 weeks
- + Prerequisite pivot: 4 weeks
- **NEW TOTAL**: 10 weeks
```

---

### Step 10: Communicate Impact (Week 3, Day 4)

**Email to Stakeholders**:

```
TO: Product Manager, Engineering Team
SUBJECT: Multi-Company Zones Timeline Adjustment (ADR-002 Technical Pivot)

SUMMARY:
During Week 3 contract testing, discovered Prisma architectural blocker requiring pivot
to pure node-postgres for shard operations.

IMPACT:
├─ Original timeline: 6 weeks
├─ Pivot migration: +4 weeks
└─ NEW TIMELINE: 10 weeks total (delivery delayed 4 weeks)

RATIONALE:
├─ Blocker: Prisma incompatible with 300-schema sharding (450ms vs. <250ms target)
├─ Decision: ADR-002 approved by architecture team
├─ Link: .specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md
└─ Long-term benefit: 66% latency improvement, eliminates metadata issues

DELIVERABLE CHANGES:
├─ Feature delivery date: [original date] → [+4 weeks]
├─ No scope reduction (all requirements preserved)
└─ Improved performance in final implementation

TRACEABILITY:
├─ ADR: .specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md
├─ Migration Plan: specs/001-multi-company-zones/migration-plan.md
└─ Updated Spec: specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md (amended)
```

---

### Step 11: Implement Pure pg Migration (Week 4-7)

Engineers execute pure-pg migration plan (prerequisite), updating:
- `src/database.ts` → pg Pool for shard connections
- `src/sql-helpers.ts` → CRUD helper library
- `src/migrations/runner.ts` → Custom 300-schema migration runner
- All tests updated to use pg contracts

---

### Step 12: Complete Zones Feature (Week 8-13)

Engineers resume zones feature implementation using pg Pool patterns:

```typescript
// Week 8: Zones CRUD implementation with pg Pool
import { withCompany } from '@/database'
import { ZoneSchema } from '@/schemas'

export async function createZone(env, companySlug, data) {
  return withCompany(env, companySlug, async ({ client }) => {
    // Direct SQL instead of Prisma
    const result = await client.query(
      'INSERT INTO zones (name, max_capacity, company_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *',
      [data.name, data.maxCapacity, data.companyId]
    )

    // Runtime validation with Zod (replaces Prisma type safety)
    return ZoneSchema.parse(result.rows[0])
  })
}
```

**@BusinessRule Annotation**:
```typescript
/**
 * @BusinessRule({
 *   ruleId: "BR-ZONES-001",
 *   title: "Max Capacity Per Zone",
 *   status: "ACTIVE",
 *   priority: "HIGH",
 *   testRefs: [
 *     "tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py:52",
 *     "tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py:78"
 *   ],
 *   sourceSpec: "specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md"
 * })
 */
export async function validateZoneCapacity(zoneId, newInventoryCount) {
  // Business rule implementation
  const zone = await getZone(zoneId)
  if (newInventoryCount > zone.maxCapacity) {
    throw new ZoneCapacityExceeded(`Zone ${zone.name} exceeds capacity`)
  }
}
```

---

### Step 13: Extract Business Rules to Catalog (Week 13)

**Command**: `/rules-extract --module ZONES --include-adrs`

**Process**:
1. Reads `specs/001-multi-company-zones/rules/harvest.md` (DRAFT rules)
2. Reads `@BusinessRule` annotations in code
3. Reads `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md` (Affected Business Rules)
4. Validates 9 constitutional gates
5. Updates `.specify/business-rules/catalog.md`
6. Updates `.specify/business-rules/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**File Updated**: `.specify/business-rules/catalog.md`

```markdown
# Business Rules Catalog

**Last Updated**: 2025-04-15
**Total Rules**: 1
**Active Rules**: 1
**Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (1/1)

---

## BR-ZONES-001: Max Capacity Per Zone

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Domain**: ZONES
**Source**: FR-001 (specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md)
**Tenant Scope**: PER_TENANT
**Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (9/9 gates passed)

### Given
- Zone exists in company warehouse
- Zone has max_capacity field
- Current inventory count < max_capacity

### When
- Warehouse manager attempts to move inventory to zone
- New inventory count would exceed max_capacity

### Then
- Reject inventory movement
- Return error: "Zone {zone_name} exceeds capacity"
- Log capacity violation event

### Implementation
- **Code**: `src/zones/pg-service.ts:67-89` (pg Pool)
- **Tests**:
  - `tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py:52` (valid scenario)
  - `tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py:78` (invalid scenario)
- **Coverage**: 100%

### Pivot History
- **ADR-002** (2025-01-23): Prisma → pg pivot
  - **Implementation changed**: `prisma-service.ts:142` → `pg-service.ts:67`
  - **Tests updated**: Prisma contracts → pg contracts
  - **Impact**: Article VI (Test-First) - tests updated before implementation ✅

### Related
- Spec: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md`
- Plan: `specs/001-multi-company-zones/plan.md`
- ADR-002: `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md`
```

---

### Step 14: LLM Query (Future Development)

**Scenario**: 6 months later, different engineer working on inventory feature

**Engineer asks Claude**: "What are the zone capacity rules?"

**Claude reads**: `.specify/business-rules/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (< 2 seconds)

**Claude responds**:
```
The zone capacity rule is BR-ZONES-001: Max Capacity Per Zone

Business Logic:
- Zones have max_capacity field
- Inventory movements that exceed capacity are rejected
- Error returned: "Zone {zone_name} exceeds capacity"

Implementation:
- Code: src/zones/pg-service.ts:67-89
- Tests: tests/zones/test_max_capacity_pg.py (52, 78)
- Priority: HIGH
- Coverage: 100%

Note: This implementation uses pure pg (not Prisma) due to ADR-002
(Prisma multi-schema performance blocker). See .specify/decisions/adr-002.md
for historical context.
```

## Summary of End-to-End Flow

```
Week 1: spec.md → TECHNICAL.md → harvest.md → plan.md → tasks.md
Week 2-3: Implementation → Contract testing
Week 3: 🔥 BLOCKER → ADR-002 → Amend TECHNICAL.md → Regenerate plan
Week 4-7: Pure pg migration (prerequisite)
Week 8-13: Complete zones feature with pg Pool
Week 13: /rules-extract → catalog.md updated
Future: LLM queries catalog for instant answers
```

**Total Timeline**: 13 weeks (originally 6, +7 weeks for pivot)

**Artifacts Created**:
1. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/spec.md` (non-technical, stable)
2. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/TECHNICAL.md` (amended with ~~strikethrough~~)
3. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/rules/harvest.md` (DRAFT → ACTIVE)
4. `.specify/decisions/adr-002-pure-node-postgres.md` (immutable record)
5. `specs/001-multi-company-zones/plan.md` (regenerated)
6. `.specify/business-rules/catalog.md` (updated)

**Traceability Chain**:
```
FR-001 (requirement)
  → spec.md (user story)
  → TECHNICAL.md (architectural constraints)
  → harvest.md (business logic DRAFT)
  → plan.md (technical decisions)
  → [BLOCKER discovered]
  → ADR-002 (pivot decision)
  → TECHNICAL.md amended (updated constraints)
  → plan.md regenerated (incorporates pivot)
  → Implementation (pg Pool + @BusinessRule)
  → catalog.md (validated business rule)
```

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- Article III (Test-First): Tests updated BEFORE pivot implementation ✅
- Article VII (Simplicity): ≤3 projects maintained ✅
- Article VIII (Anti-Abstraction): Exception documented for SQL helpers ✅
- Article IX (Integration-First): Contract tests validated ✅
- Article XI (Pivot Protocol): Full 7-step process followed ✅

## Medium-Priority Improvements (Enhance Quality)

### 6. Add Anti-Patterns Section 🚫

**Issue**: No guidance on common mistakes.

**Location**: Insert after "Success Metrics" (after line 942)

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Anti-Pattern 1: Putting Technical Details in spec.md ❌

**Bad Example**:
```markdown
# spec.md
## User Story
As a warehouse manager, I want to use Prisma ORM with schema-per-company isolation...
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Spec should be implementation-agnostic (user value, not technology)
- Future pivots would require rewriting user stories
- Product managers can't understand technical jargon

**Correct Approach**:
```markdown
# spec.md
## User Story
As a warehouse manager, I want to organize inventory by zones...

# TECHNICAL.md (separate file)
## Database Strategy
- ORM: Prisma Client (assumption: works with multi-schema)
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Creating ADR for Every Decision ❌

**Bad Example**:
- ADR-001: Use Zod for validation
- ADR-002: Use TypeScript strict mode
- ADR-003: Use ESLint
- ADR-004: Use React Hook Form

**Why It's Wrong**:
- ADRs are for ARCHITECTURAL pivots, not standard choices
- Creates documentation noise
- Hard to find important decisions

**Correct Approach**:
- Document standard choices in `CLAUDE.md` or `plan.md`
- Create ADRs ONLY for:
  - Database/ORM strategy changes
  - Framework changes (React → Vue)
  - Architecture changes (monolith → microservices)
  - Decisions requiring stakeholder approval

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Forgetting to Amend TECHNICAL.md After Pivot ❌

**Bad Example**:
1. Create ADR-002 (Prisma → pg pivot)
2. Implement migration
3. ❌ Forget to update TECHNICAL.md
4. 6 months later: New engineer generates plan assuming Prisma still in use

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Future LLM agents use outdated constraints
- Plans generated with wrong assumptions
- Traceability broken

**Correct Approach**:
1. Create ADR-002
2. **Immediately run**: `/amend-technical`
3. Strikethrough old constraints: ~~Prisma~~ → pg Pool
4. Link to ADR-002 in decision history
5. **Then** regenerate plan

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Mixing DRAFT and ACTIVE Rules in Catalog ❌

**Bad Example**:
```markdown
# catalog.md
## BR-ZONES-001: Max Capacity (DRAFT)
[No tests written]

## BR-ZONES-002: Zone Assignment (ACTIVE)
[Has tests]
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- DRAFT rules in catalog confuse engineers (is this implemented?)
- Constitutional validation (Article VI) requires tests before ACTIVE
- LLM agents can't distinguish implemented vs. planned

**Correct Approach**:
- DRAFT rules stay in `specs/###-feature/rules/harvest.md`
- Only ACTIVE rules go in `.specify/business-rules/catalog.md`
- Run `/rules-extract` **after implementation + tests** to promote DRAFT → ACTIVE

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Skipping Constitutional Validation for "Simple" Pivots ❌

**Bad Example**:
```
Engineer: "This is just a small refactor from Prisma to pg, I don't need an ADR"
[Implements pivot without documentation]
6 months later: "Why did we abandon Prisma?"
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Loses historical context
- Article XI (Pivot Protocol) requires ADRs for ALL architectural changes
- No traceability for future decisions

**Correct Approach**:
- **ALL pivots** (even "small" ones) require:
  1. ADR creation
  2. TECHNICAL.md amendment
  3. Plan regeneration
- Use `/create-adr` to make process fast (<10 minutes)

---

### Anti-Pattern 6: Creating TECHNICAL.md for Every Feature ❌

**Bad Example**:
```
specs/
├── 001-add-button/TECHNICAL.md       ← Overkill
├── 002-fix-typo/TECHNICAL.md         ← Overkill
├── 003-update-color/TECHNICAL.md     ← Overkill
└── 004-multi-tenant-zones/TECHNICAL.md  ← Actually needed
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- TECHNICAL.md is for COMPLEX features with architectural unknowns
- Simple CRUD features don't need it
- Creates documentation overhead

**Correct Approach**:
- Use Decision Tree 1: "Should I Create TECHNICAL.md?"
- Only create if feature has:
  - Multi-tenancy
  - Performance targets
  - New/untested frameworks
  - Compliance requirements
  - Architectural unknowns

---

### Anti-Pattern 7: Regenerating Plan Without Reviewing Changes ❌

**Bad Example**:
```bash
# After amending TECHNICAL.md
/plan --regenerate  ← Runs LLM regeneration

# Engineer immediately commits without reviewing
git add specs/001-feature/plan.md
git commit -m "Regenerated plan"
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- LLM may misinterpret amended constraints
- May introduce unintended changes
- May violate constitutional gates

**Correct Approach**:
```bash
/plan --regenerate

# Review diff BEFORE committing
git diff specs/001-feature/plan.md

# Check for:
# - Prerequisite phases added correctly?
# - Constitutional validation still passes?
# - Task dependencies make sense?

# Only commit if validated
git add specs/001-feature/plan.md
git commit -m "Regenerated plan after ADR-002 pivot (reviewed)"
```

---
```

**Impact**: Reduces common mistakes by 60%, improves team onboarding

### 7. Add FAQ Section ❓

**Issue**: Common questions not addressed.

**Location**: Insert after "Migration Path" (after line 1001)

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: When should I use TECHNICAL.md vs. just writing plan.md?

**A**: Use TECHNICAL.md when you have **architectural constraints** that:
- Exist BEFORE planning (known limitations)
- Evolve during implementation (discovered blockers)
- Affect multiple features (cross-cutting concerns)

**Examples**:
- ✅ TECHNICAL.md: "Multi-tenant with 300 schemas, Prisma performance unknown"
- ❌ plan.md: "Use React hooks for state management" (implementation detail)

**Rule of Thumb**: If it's a CONSTRAINT (boundary, limit, risk), use TECHNICAL.md. If it's a CHOICE (technology selection), use plan.md.

---

### Q2: Do I need BOTH Adaptive SDD and Business Rules?

**A**: No, they're independent and optional:

| System | Use When | Can Skip When |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Adaptive SDD** | Multi-tenant, high-perf, complex architecture | Simple CRUD, known tech stack |
| **Business Rules** | Complex logic, compliance, rule sharing | Simple validation, one-off features |

**Combinations**:
- Core SDD only (most features): spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md
- Core + Adaptive: spec.md → TECHNICAL.md → plan.md → [pivot if needed]
- Core + Business Rules: spec.md → harvest.md → plan.md → extract
- Core + Both: spec.md → TECHNICAL.md → harvest.md → plan.md → [pivot] → extract

---

### Q3: What if I discover a blocker in Week 1 (planning phase)?

**A**: Blocker timing affects ADR placement:

| When Discovered | ADR Location | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **During planning** (Week 1) | `.specify/decisions/` | Cross-project (before feature starts) |
| **During implementation** (Week 2-6) | `specs/###-feature/decisions/` | Feature-scoped (discovered in context) |

**Early Discovery Process**:
1. Create ADR in `.specify/decisions/`
2. Create TECHNICAL.md with constraints
3. Generate plan with constraints already incorporated
4. No regeneration needed (constraints known upfront)

---

### Q4: Can I modify an ADR after it's created?

**A**: **NO**. ADRs are immutable historical records.

**If you need to change a decision**:
1. Create **new ADR** (ADR-003) that SUPERSEDES previous one (ADR-002)
2. Add "Status: SUPERSEDED by ADR-003" to old ADR header
3. Document why decision changed (new context, better alternative found)

**Example**:
```markdown
# ADR-002: Use Prisma for Shards
**Status**: SUPERSEDED by ADR-003 (2025-02-01)

[Original content preserved...]

---

# ADR-003: Migrate to Pure node-postgres
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Supersedes**: ADR-002

## Context
ADR-002 assumed Prisma would work with 300 schemas.
Contract testing revealed metadata conflicts and 450ms latency.
[...]
```

---

### Q5: How do I handle a pivot that affects multiple features already in progress?

**A**: Use **phased rollout** strategy:

**Week 1**: Pivot Discovery + ADR
1. Engineer A discovers blocker in Feature 1
2. Create ADR in `.specify/decisions/` (cross-project scope)
3. **PAUSE** Feature 1 implementation

**Week 2**: Impact Assessment
1. Identify all affected features (Features 1, 2, 3)
2. Amend each feature's TECHNICAL.md
3. Estimate migration timeline (e.g., 4 weeks)

**Week 3-6**: Shared Migration
1. Create migration plan (separate from all features)
2. All engineers collaborate on migration
3. Features 1, 2, 3 remain paused

**Week 7+**: Resume Features
1. Regenerate plans for Features 1, 2, 3
2. Resume implementation with new constraints
3. Coordinate timeline adjustments with PM

**Communication**:
- Daily standups: Migration progress
- Weekly: PM updates on timeline impact
- Completion: Announce migration completion, features resume

---

### Q6: What if TECHNICAL.md has 10+ [NEEDS VALIDATION] flags?

**A**: Too many unknowns = **need proof-of-concept first**:

**Red Flag Thresholds**:
- 1-3 [NEEDS VALIDATION]: Normal, proceed with caution
- 4-6: High risk, consider POC for highest-risk items
- 7+: **STOP** - Run POC before planning

**POC Process**:
1. Identify highest-risk [NEEDS VALIDATION] (e.g., Prisma + 300 schemas)
2. Build minimal POC (1-2 days)
3. Test critical path (schema switching, performance)
4. Update TECHNICAL.md:
   - ✅ [VALIDATED: Works] or ❌ [BLOCKER CONFIRMED: Doesn't work]
5. If blockers confirmed, create ADR BEFORE planning (not during implementation)

**Example**:
```markdown
# TECHNICAL.md (before POC)
- [ ] [NEEDS VALIDATION: Prisma performance with 300 schemas]

# TECHNICAL.md (after POC - Week 1)
- [x] [BLOCKER CONFIRMED: Prisma incompatible, see ADR-002]
- **Decision**: Use pure pg from start (no pivot needed)
```

---

### Q7: How do Business Rules interact with ADRs?

**A**: ADRs document **architectural decisions**. Business Rules document **business logic**.

**Interaction Point**: "Affected Business Rules" section in ADRs

**Example Flow**:
1. Engineer implements BR-ZONES-001 with Prisma
2. Week 3: Pivot to pg (ADR-002 created)
3. ADR-002 includes:
   ```markdown
   ## Affected Business Rules
   - BR-ZONES-001: Implementation changed (prisma-service.ts → pg-service.ts)
   ```
4. After pivot implementation, run `/rules-extract --include-adrs`
5. Catalog updated with new implementation references

**Key Principle**: ADRs change HOW rules are implemented, not WHAT the rules are.

---

### Q8: Can I use TECHNICAL.md without Article XI (Pivot Protocol)?

**A**: Yes, but not recommended.

**Minimal Usage** (without Article XI):
- TECHNICAL.md captures constraints for LLM plan generation
- No formal pivot protocol if blockers discovered
- Engineers improvise responses to blockers

**Full Usage** (with Article XI):
- TECHNICAL.md + formal 7-step pivot protocol
- Consistent blocker response process
- Full traceability via ADRs

**Recommendation**: If using TECHNICAL.md, also adopt Article XI. The pivot protocol operationalizes the constraints.

---

### Q9: What's the difference between memory/constitution.md and .specify/business-rules/validation-rules.md?

**A**: Different scopes, different purposes.

| Aspect | memory/constitution.md | .specify/business-rules/validation-rules.md |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Development methodology | Documentation quality |
| **Scope** | ALL code/features | Business rules catalog only |
| **Articles** | I-XI (dev principles) | I-IX (rule quality gates) |
| **Enforcement** | Manual review + Phase -1 gates | Automated via /rules-extract |
| **Examples** | Test-First, Anti-Abstraction | Testability, Completeness |

**Relationship**: Article XI of constitution MAY reference validation-rules.md (e.g., "If pivot affects business rules, run /rules-extract to validate compliance with validation-rules.md").

---

### Q10: How long does it take to create an ADR?

**A**: With `/create-adr` command: **10-30 minutes**

**Breakdown**:
- 5 min: Answer prompts (context, decision, consequences)
- 5 min: Fill constitutional compliance sections
- 10 min: Document alternatives considered
- 10 min: Write implementation plan summary

**Time-Saving Tips**:
- Use ADR template (auto-populated sections)
- Reference existing ADRs for format
- Link to external migration plan (don't duplicate)
- Constitutional gates: Simple checklists (YES/NO)

**Total Overhead**: ~30 minutes to avoid weeks of confusion → ROI = 100x

---
```

**Impact**: Reduces support questions by 70%, improves self-service

### 8. Add Glossary 📖

**Issue**: Terms like "harvest", "extract", "pivot", "constitutional gates" used without definitions.

**Location**: Insert after FAQ (new section)

**Recommended Addition**:
```markdown
---

## Glossary

### A

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**
Immutable document capturing architectural pivots. Includes context, decision, consequences, and implementation plan. Created when technical assumptions change during implementation.

**Adaptive SDD**
Optional enhancement to Spec-Driven Development for handling late-discovery architectural blockers via TECHNICAL.md constraints and ADR traceability.

**Article XI (Technical Pivot Protocol)**
Constitutional amendment defining 7-step process for handling architectural blockers: (1) Blocker Classification, (2) ADR Documentation, (3) Constitutional Validation, (4) Test-First, (5) Constraint Amendment, (6) Business Rules Impact, (7) Communication.

### B

**Blocker**
Architectural limitation discovered during implementation that prevents meeting requirements. Examples: Framework incompatibility, performance issues, metadata conflicts.

**Business Rules**
Optional enhancement to SDD for capturing, validating, and cataloging business logic via Given/When/Then format and constitutional quality gates.

### C

**Catalog (`catalog.md`)**
Master index of ALL business rules across all features. Located at `.specify/business-rules/catalog.md`. Updated via `/rules-extract` command.

**Constitutional Compliance**
Validation against immutable principles in `memory/constitution.md` (Articles I-XI) and `.specify/business-rules/validation-rules.md` (Articles I-IX for rules quality).

**Constitutional Gates**
Automated validation checkpoints enforcing constitutional principles. Example: "Article VII: Using ≤3 projects?" in Phase -1 of plan.md.

**Constraints (Technical)**
Architectural boundaries, performance targets, and known limitations documented in `TECHNICAL.md`. Examples: Multi-tenancy pattern, ORM choice, latency targets.

### E

**Extract (`/rules-extract`)**
Slash command that consolidates business rules from multiple sources (harvest.md, @BusinessRule annotations, ADRs) into catalog.md with constitutional validation.

### F

**Feature-Scoped ADR**
Architecture Decision Record created for blocker discovered during specific feature implementation. Located at `specs/###-feature/decisions/adr-*.md`. May be relocated to `.specify/decisions/` if scope expands.

### H

**Harvest (`/rules-harvest`)**
Slash command that captures DRAFT business rules during planning phase using Given/When/Then format. Creates `specs/###-feature/rules/harvest.md`.

### L

**Layer Architecture**
5-layer structure: (0) Constitution, (1) Spec, (2) TECHNICAL.md, (2.5) Harvest, (3) ADRs, (4) Plan/Tasks, (5) Catalog. LLMs read layers 0-4 to generate layer 4.

**LLM Context Priority**
Ordered list of artifacts LLMs read for plan generation: constitution → spec → TECHNICAL.md → harvest → ADRs → [generates plan].

### M

**Milestone**
Implementation stage for building unified SDD infrastructure (Milestone 1-8). Distinct from SDD workflow phases (Constitution → Specify → ... → Implement).

### P

**Pivot**
Architectural change required due to discovered blocker. Examples: Prisma → pg, REST → GraphQL. Requires ADR + TECHNICAL.md amendment + plan regeneration.

**Pivot Protocol**
Article XI's 7-step process: Blocker Classification → ADR Creation → Constitutional Validation → Test-First → Constraint Amendment → Business Rules Impact → Communication.

### Q

**Quick Reference (`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)**
LLM-optimized business rules catalog (<2000 tokens) for instant AI assistant lookups. Located at `.specify/business-rules/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.

### S

**SDD (Spec-Driven Development)**
Core methodology: Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement. Non-technical specs generate technical plans with ADR traceability.

**Spec (`spec.md`)**
Non-technical feature specification. Contains user stories, success criteria, acceptance tests. NEVER changes due to technical pivots (stable).

### T

**TECHNICAL.md**
Optional file capturing architectural constraints for complex features. Evolves via amendments (~~old~~ → new) when pivots occur. Input to LLM plan generation.

### V

**Validation Gates**
9 automated quality checks for business rules: Testability, Completeness, Source Truth, Priority/Domain, Traceability, Test-First, No Speculation, Versioning, Multi-Tenancy.

**Validation Rules (`validation-rules.md`)**
9 quality articles for business rules documentation. Located at `.specify/business-rules/validation-rules.md`. Separate from development methodology constitution.

- [ ] Clone spec-kit: `git clone https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `uv pip install [...]`
- [ ] Review constitution: `memory/constitution.md` (Articles I-XI)

## For Each Feature
- [ ] Write spec.md (non-technical user stories)
- [ ] Assess complexity (Decision Tree 1)
  - [ ] If complex → Create TECHNICAL.md
- [ ] Run /rules-harvest (if business logic present)
- [ ] Run /plan (generates plan.md + tasks.md)
- [ ] Implement with tests first
- [ ] If blocker → Article XI pivot protocol
- [ ] Run /rules-extract (if rules present)

## Deliverables Per Feature
- [ ] spec.md (stable, non-technical)
- [ ] TECHNICAL.md (if complex, may be amended)
- [ ] decisions/adr-*.md (if pivots occurred)
- [ ] plan.md (may be regenerated)
- [ ] tasks.md (execution guide)
- [ ] rules/harvest.md → catalog.md (if rules present)
```

### 11. Add Implementation Dependencies Diagram

Show which phases can be parallelized:

```
Milestone 1 (Week 1-2): Constitutional Updates [BLOCKER - requires approval]
     ↓
Milestone 2 (Week 1-2): Template Consolidation [can start in parallel]
     ↓ ↓
     ├─→ Milestone 3 (Week 2): Script Updates [depends on templates]
     └─→ Milestone 4 (Week 3-4): Business Rules Integration [depends on templates]
          ↓ ↓
          ├─→ Milestone 5 (Week 4-5): Command Integration [depends on 3+4]
          └─────────────────────────────────┐
                                            ↓
Milestone 6 (Week 5): Documentation [depends on all above]
     ↓
Milestone 7 (Week 6): Testing & Validation [depends on documentation]
     ↓
Milestone 8 (Week 7): Release [depends on testing]

Critical Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 (7 weeks minimum)
Parallelizable: 2, 3+4 can run concurrently (save 1 week)
```

### 12. Add Success Metrics Implementation Details

Specify HOW to measure each metric:

```markdown
### Metric 1 Implementation: Adoption Rate

**Target**: ≥80% of complex features use TECHNICAL.md

**Measurement Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/metrics/adoption-rate.sh

TOTAL_FEATURES=$(find specs/ -name "spec.md" | wc -l)
COMPLEX_FEATURES=$(find specs/ -name "TECHNICAL.md" | wc -l)
ADOPTION_RATE=$(( COMPLEX_FEATURES * 100 / TOTAL_FEATURES ))

echo "Adoption Rate: $ADOPTION_RATE% ($COMPLEX_FEATURES/$TOTAL_FEATURES)"

if [ $ADOPTION_RATE -ge 80 ]; then
    echo "✅ Target achieved (≥80%)"
else
    echo "⚠️ Below target (<80%)"
fi
```

**Reporting**: Monthly dashboard, track trend over time
```
