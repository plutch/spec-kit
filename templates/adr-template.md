## Constitutional Compliance (Article XI.3)

### Article VII: Simplicity Gate
**Assessment**: [PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL]
- Concern: [Does this add new project/framework?]
- Justification: [Why additional complexity is warranted]
- Architect Approval: [ ] Required | [ ] Not Required
- Approval Status: [ ] Granted | [ ] Pending

### Article VIII: Anti-Abstraction Gate
**Assessment**: [PASS | FAIL]
- Framework Trust: [Is new technology well-maintained and trusted?]
- Custom Wrappers: [Are we introducing unnecessary abstractions?]
- Community Support: [Active development, documentation quality]

### Article IX: Integration-First Gate
**Assessment**: [PASS | FAIL]
- Contract Tests: [ ] Updated BEFORE implementation
- Real Dependencies: [ ] Using actual databases/services (no mocks)
- Test Status: [ ] RED phase validated

### [Article X: Project-Specific]
**Assessment**: [PASS | FAIL]
- [Add project-specific constitutional requirements]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1 - e.g., 90% latency reduction]
- [Benefit 2 - e.g., Supports 10,000+ tenant schemas]
- [Benefit 3 - e.g., Simpler mental model]

### Negative
- [Tradeoff 1 - e.g., Lose Prisma type safety]
- [Tradeoff 2 - e.g., Engineers must write SQL manually]
- [Tradeoff 3 - e.g., Two database access patterns in codebase]

### Mitigation
- [How to address Negative 1]
- [How to address Negative 2]
- [How to address Negative 3]

###  Risks
- [Risk 1 and mitigation plan]
- [Risk 2 and mitigation plan]

## Affected Business Rules (Article XI.6)

### Modified Rules
- **BR-[DOMAIN]-[NUMBER]**: [Rule Name]
  - **Implementation Change**:
    - FROM: `src/path/file.ts:line` (old tech)
    - TO: `src/path/new-file.ts:line` (new tech)
  - **Test Change**:
    - FROM: `tests/path/test_old.py:line`
    - TO: `tests/path/test_new.py:line`
  - **Action**: Update catalog via `/rules-extract --module [MODULE]`
  - **Constitutional Impact**: [Which article validation affected]

### New Rules Created
- **BR-[DOMAIN]-[NUMBER]**: [New Rule Name]
  - **Reason**: [Why pivot introduces new business logic]
  - **Status**: DRAFT (pending implementation)
  - **Domain**: [MODULE]

### No Business Rules Affected
[ ] This decision is purely architectural with no business logic impact

## Timeline Impact (Article XI.7)

### Original Estimate
- Start: Week [X]
- End: Week [Y]
- Duration: [Z] weeks

### Adjusted Estimate (Post-Pivot)
- Pivot Decision: Week [X]
- Pivot Implementation: Week [X+1] - Week [Y+2]
- New End Date: Week [Y+2]
- Timeline Adjustment: +[N] weeks

### Breakdown
- Week [X]: Create ADR + update contract tests (RED phase)
- Week [X+1]: [Pivot implementation tasks]
- Week [Y+1]: [Testing and validation]
- Week [Y+2]: [Integration and deployment]

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (Article XI.4 - Test-First)
1. [ ] Update contract tests to reflect new architecture
2. [ ] Validate tests FAIL with current implementation (RED phase)
3. [ ] Obtain user approval of test changes
4. [ ] Update `TECHNICAL.md` with amended constraints

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. [ ] [Specific implementation task 1]
2. [ ] [Specific implementation task 2]
3. [ ] [@BusinessRule annotations updated with new references]
4. [ ] [Integration points addressed]

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] All contract tests pass (GREEN phase)
2. [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
3. [ ] Business rules catalog updated (`/rules-extract`)
4. [ ] Integration tests pass

### Phase 4: Communication (Article XI.7)
1. [ ] Stakeholders informed of timeline impact
2. [ ] ADR added to decision log
3. [ ] Sprint/release plan adjusted
4. [ ] Documentation updated

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers
Rollback if:
- [Condition 1 - e.g., P95 latency >target in production]
- [Condition 2 - e.g., Critical bug discovered within 48 hours]
